<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> writer has attempted to describe in this
volume the life of two young midshipmen of
the United States Navy, serving in a small
gunboat in Philippine waters.</p>

<p>The fighting between the United States
troops and the lawless bands of Filipino
bandits (for they were bandits, more or less,
after Aguinaldo&#8217;s army had been dispersed)
was in most cases &#8220;hand to hand&#8221; and to the
death. The navy had but small share in this
war, but in some instances the helpful co&ouml;peration
of their web-footed brothers saved
the soldiers from embarrassing situations.</p>

<p>Midshipman Philip Perry and his classmate
at Annapolis, Sydney Monroe, first made their
appearance in &#8220;A United States Midshipman
Afloat.&#8221; They had a part in stirring adventures
during one of the frequent South American
revolutions. Here they became involved
in diplomatic intrigue, and had some success;
but unfortunately diplomatic successes cannot
always be proclaimed to the world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>&#8220;A United States Midshipman in China&#8221;
told of the adventures of the same boys
in China during a threatened uprising of
fanatical Chinese against the foreigners.
Here again diplomacy counseled silence, and
their reward for saving the day was a mild rebuke
from their admiral. One of the principal
characters in all three books is Jack O&#8217;Neil, a
typical modern man-of-war&#8217;s man.</p>

<p>These books are written in an endeavor to
portray the life led by young officers in the
naval service. The writer&#8217;s own experiences
warrant the belief that the incidents are not
unusual. The midshipmen are not merely
automatons. To one of Napoleon&#8217;s pawns an
order was an order, to be obeyed, right or
wrong. But the doctrine, &#8220;their&#8217;s not to
reason why&#8221; when &#8220;some one has blundered&#8221;
is no longer accepted as an excuse for poor results.
In these days of progress we court-martial
an officer who stubbornly obeys an
order, when he knows that to do so will injure
the cause he has sworn to uphold.</p>

<p>Further account of the boys&#8217; stirring adventures
will be found in &#8220;A U. S. Midshipman in
Japan&#8221; and &#8220;A U. S. Midshipman in the South
Seas.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE START FOR PALILO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> &#8220;Isla de Negros,&#8221; a small inter-island
steamer, lay moored alongside the dock in the
turbulent waters of the Pasig River, the commercial
artery of the city of Manila. As the
last of its cargo was noisily carried on board
by a swarm of half-naked stevedores, the
slender lines which held the steamer to the
stone quay were cast off, and with many shrill
screeches from its high treble whistle the
steamer swung its blunt bow out into the
strength of the current.</p>

<p>On the upper deck of the vessel, clad in
white naval uniforms, two United States midshipmen
stood in silent contemplation of the
activity about them. They watched with undisguised
interest the hundreds of toiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
orientals; resembling many ant swarms,
traveling and retraveling incessantly between
the countless hulls of steamers and lorchas and
the long rows of hastily constructed storehouses
facing the river frontage. Here and
there stood a khaki-clad sentry, rifle in hand
and belt filled with ball cartridges, America&#8217;s
guardian of the precious stores now being
idly collected. Into these spacious storehouses
the sinews of war for the army of occupation
were being hoarded to be afterward
redistributed among the small steamers plying
between the metropolis, Manila, and the outlying
islands of the archipelago.</p>

<p>The American army in the Philippines, always
too small for the stupendous task before
it, was at last, owing to the added disaffection
of the tribes in the Southern islands, receiving
the attention from home which had long been
withheld, and its numbers were being increased
by the arrival of every transport from the far-away
homeland.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are here at last, Syd,&#8221; Midshipman
Philip Perry exclaimed, a ring of triumph in
his voice as he turned toward his fellow midshipman,
Sydney Monroe. Friends of long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
standing were these two; for four years at the
Naval Academy at Annapolis they had been
companions and classmates, and during the
past year they had together witnessed stirring
service in South America and in China.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve missed nearly six months of the
war,&#8221; Sydney replied querulously; &#8220;from the
last accounts, Aguinaldo is on the run.
Why,&#8221; he ended mirthlessly, &#8220;the war may
be over before we even see the &#8216;Mindinao.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pessimistic as usual,&#8221; Phil laughingly
retorted; &#8220;where we are going, in the words
of the immortal John Paul Jones, they
&#8216;haven&#8217;t begun to fight.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The steamer had now swung her bow down
river, and the chug of the engines told the
lads that they were fairly started on their
voyage to Palilo, the capital of the island of
Kapay, where the gunboat &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; was
awaiting them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, what&#8217;s this?&#8221; Phil exclaimed,
while the engine bell rang with throaty
clanks, and the chugging of the engines
ceased. The two lads leaning inquiringly
over the rail, saw a small navy launch steam
alongside the moving steamer; then a tightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
lashed bag and hammock were thrown on
deck, and finally from the depths of the white
canopied awning there appeared the familiar
form of a sailor, who sprang nimbly on board,
waving a parting good-bye to his mates, while
the launch swung away; and again the &#8220;Negros&#8217;&#8221;
engines chugged noisily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack O&#8217;Neil!&#8221; the two lads cried, their
faces beaming with surprised pleasure as they
grasped the newcomer&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me, sir,&#8221; the sailor declared ungrammatically
though heartily, highly delighted
at his enthusiastic reception. &#8220;Telegraphic
orders from the admiral to report to Midshipman
Perry, commanding the gunboat
&#8216;Mindinao.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where&#8217;s your old ship, the &#8216;Monadnock&#8217;?&#8221;
Sydney questioned blankly. &#8220;We
looked for her this morning as we came in on
the cattle boat from Hongkong. Is she in
the bay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, sir, she is,&#8221; returned O&#8217;Neil, &#8220;over
there at Paranaque keeping the ladrones out
of the navy-yard with her ten-inch guns.
They made a rush for it once, about six
months ago, then the gugus had an army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
and we were kept guessing; but a few brace
of hot ten-inch birds, exploding near them
from our coffee kettle of a monitor soon
made &#8217;em change their minds. They decided
they hadn&#8217;t lost nothing at the navy-yard
after all. But,&#8221; he ended, the enthusiasm
dying out of his voice, &#8220;that, I said, was six
months ago; we&#8217;ve been bailing out there
ever since, awnings furled, guns loaded, expecting
to be boarded every night.&#8221; He made
a gesture of utter disgust as he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t know anything, these gugus,&#8221;
he began again, seeing that his friends didn&#8217;t
understand his disjointed explanation; &#8220;they
won&#8217;t try to board a man-of-war. They&#8217;ll
attack you on shore; but as for paddling out
in their canoes to capture a steel monitor,
it&#8217;s too absurd. Yet we stood watch on and
watch off every night waiting for &#8217;em to
board. Do you blame me, sir, for feeling
happy when I got these orders?&#8221; tapping his
telegram against an awning stanchion. &#8220;This
means life again; like we had in the dago
country and up with them pigtailed chinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen slapped the loquacious
sailor joyfully on the back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re not half as glad to be with us as
we are to have you,&#8221; Phil exclaimed frankly.
&#8220;We&#8217;re just aching for something worth while&mdash;we&#8217;ve
been roasting up on the Yangtse River
since you left us, doing nothing except watch
the grass burn up and the water in the river
fall. I never felt such heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the Americans were talking the
little steamer slipped noisily down the busy
river and out on the bay made famous by Admiral
Dewey on that memorable May morning.</p>

<p>Corregidor Island lifted itself slowly out
of a molten sea to the westward. The
&#8220;Negros&#8217;&#8221; bow was pointed out through the
southern channel, passing close to the precipitous
island, standing like an unbending
sentinel on guard between the wide portals of
the Bay of Manila.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few guns over there on Corregidor
would soon stop this talk of our waking up
some morning and finding Manila at the
mercy of an enemy,&#8221; Phil declared after
studying the landscape earnestly. &#8220;But
these islands are too far away for our people
at home to take much interest. Half of
them would be glad to see another nation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
wrest them from us.&mdash;Hello! there&#8217;s one of
those native lorchas,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> he added as his keen
eye discovered a sail some miles away almost
ahead of their steamer; &#8220;we passed one coming
in this morning on the &#8216;Rubi.&#8217; I looked
at her through the captain&#8217;s spy-glass; her
crew were the ugliest looking cutthroats I&#8217;ve
ever seen. They reminded me of that picture
&#8216;Revenge.&#8217; Do you know it?&#8221; he asked suddenly
turning to Sydney, and then describing
the picture in mock tragic tones: &#8220;A half
score of scowling Malays, in the bow of their
&#8216;Vinta&#8217;; their curved swords in their mouths
and their evil faces lustful with passion and
hope of blood, approaching their defenseless
victims. I hope the captain gives them a
wide berth, for I haven&#8217;t even a revolver.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Americans had so far discovered but
few people on board the steamer; the captain
and pilot were on the bridge while on the
lower decks there were scarcely a dozen lazy
natives, listlessly cleaning the soiled decks
and coiling up the confused roping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;Do you think we are the only passengers?&#8221;
Sydney asked as they entered their
stateroom to make ready for the evening meal.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there must be others, for I heard a
woman&#8217;s voice in a cabin near ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they again emerged on deck and walked
aft to where their steamer chairs had been
placed, a young Filipino girl rose from her
seat and bowed courteously to the two young
officers. Phil noticed as he saluted that she
was a remarkably pretty girl of the higher
class dressed in becoming native costume, and
from her dark eyes there shone intelligence
and knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I one of the se&ntilde;or&#8217;s chairs?&#8221; she
asked in excellent Spanish. &#8220;It was very
stupid of me to have forgotten mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads remarked at once the air of good
breeding and the pleasing voice; the guttural
lisp so common in the Malay was lacking.
She could not have appeared more at
her ease and yet they saw by her dark skin
and straight black hair that no other blood
than the native flowed in her veins.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my small brother,&#8221; she explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
as a slight lad of about seven came toward
them from behind a small boat, resting on the
skids of the upper deck. &#8220;He is my only
companion,&#8221; she added half shyly.</p>

<p>The midshipmen were at a loss how to talk
to this girl of an alien race. If her skin had
been fair they would have welcomed her
gladly, seeing before them a pleasant two
days of companionship before they would arrive
at their destination; but she belonged to
a race whose color they had been taught to
believe placed her on a social footing far beneath
their own.</p>

<p>The girl seemed to divine the hesitancy in
the midshipmen&#8217;s manner, and for a second a
slight flush spread over her dark cheeks.</p>

<p>Phil was the first to recover and break the
embarrassing silence, heartily ashamed of
himself for his boorish manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are glad, se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; he commenced
haltingly in Spanish which had become rusty
through lack of practice, &#8220;to have you use
our chairs, and also,&#8221; he ended lamely, &#8220;to
have you with us. I fear we are the only
passengers.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few moments later a servant announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
dinner, and the four took their seats at a table
spread on the upper deck after the custom of
the tropics.</p>

<p>&#8220;The captain will not be with us,&#8221; the girl
explained as Phil&#8217;s eyes rested inquiringly on
the seat at the head of the table; &#8220;he begs that
we will excuse him, for he is navigating the
ship through the entrance to the bay.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat down in silence; Phil&#8217;s seat was
next to this remarkable girl.</p>

<p>In a few moments both lads had quite forgotten
that her skin was dark, so skilfully did
she preside over the plentiful board, attentive
to their wants with the natural grace of one
accustomed to dispense hospitality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Juan and I are on our way to Palilo to
join our father,&#8221; she explained after the meal
had fairly started. &#8220;I am very much concerned
over the bad news I have heard. Oh! I hope
we shall not have war in our beautiful island,&#8221;
she added appealingly, &#8220;but the Filipinos are
so ignorant; they will follow blindly where
they are led, and so many of our educated
men are at heart bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been some fighting there already?&#8221;
Phil questioned.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but it has been only
guerilla warfare so far. My father fears that
reinforcements may come from the north.
The natives in Luzon are of the Tagalo race,
and if they come after being driven from their
island by the American troops, we shall have
the horrors of war on Kapay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen&#8217;s eyes sparkled; they were
just about to express their delight at this possibility
when they suddenly realized that she
was of the same blood as those they were wishing
to fight.</p>

<p>Phil was the first to see the reproving look
in the girl&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not blame us, se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; he
hastened to say apologetically. &#8220;You see fighting
is our business; we look for it the same
as a merchant looks for trade or a fisherman
for fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think your ideas are wrong, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; she replied
quickly, but in a caressing tone, to soften
the sting. &#8220;Your duty is not necessarily to
fight, but to prevent fighting. The sisters in the
convent taught us that a soldier&#8217;s duty was to
uphold the honor of his country. If fighting
only will accomplish this duty, then it is just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
to fight, but in this case no honor is at stake.
How can our people hurt the honor of a great
nation like yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil blushed half angrily, half in shame.
This girl of a dark race had the temerity to
tell him what was his duty, and he was defenseless,
for she was in the right.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true, se&ntilde;orita, what you say,&#8221; Sydney
came to the rescue, &#8220;but peace for us is very
monotonous, always the same eternal grind.
War is exciting; it stirs the blood and makes
men of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; the girl answered in a low,
hard voice, &#8220;and it arouses all the evil passions
in us. We forget all our training, all
our ideals, all our instincts for good, and give
way to the instincts of the beasts. My people
in war are not men, se&ntilde;or, they are demons.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the girl was talking the steamer had
drawn closer to the lorcha which Phil had
sighted earlier in the afternoon. The night
was not bright; a crescent moon cast a dim
light on the hull scarcely a hundred yards on
the weather bow. The breeze had freshened,
and with wind free the lorcha&#8217;s sails bellied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
out, giving it a speed almost equal to that of
the steamer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he give that sail a wider
berth?&#8221; Phil exclaimed suddenly as the
girl&#8217;s voice died away. &#8220;If she should yaw
now, she&#8217;d be into us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; Sydney cried in alarm as the
lorcha suddenly sheered to leeward and the
great mass of tautening canvas careened toward
the unsuspecting steamer.</p>

<p>The midshipmen were on their feet in an
instant, while O&#8217;Neil came running up from
the deck below.</p>

<p>The Spanish captain, calling loudly to all
his saints to witness that it was not his fault,
jammed the helm to starboard, throwing the
steamer&#8217;s bow away from the rapidly approaching
lorcha. The engine bell clanked
riotously, as the excited Spanish captain
rang for more speed. Then the Americans&#8217;
blood froze in their veins, for the chugging of
the noisy engines had ceased in a wheezy
wail, and the &#8220;Negros&#8221; lay helpless, almost
motionless in the path of the strange sail to
windward.</p>

<p>The lads looked at each other in consternation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
The suddenness of the emergency had
rendered them powerless to act.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it only a stupid blunder? Or was it
by design that the silent lorcha had shifted
its helm and stood down upon the demoralized
steamer?&#8221; were the questions that came into
their minds.</p>

<p>A guttural hail from the lorcha accompanied
by a fusillade of rifle-shots put an end
to all doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pirates!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil gasped as he dislodged
an iron crowbar from a boat skid. &#8220;And
there isn&#8217;t a gun among us.&#8221;</p>

<p>A bright glare suddenly darted from the
bridge of the steamer as some one turned on
the current for the search-light, and the
Americans saw in the bright beam a motley
crew of natives lining the lorcha&#8217;s rail, their
eager bodies crouched ready to spring upon the
deck of their helpless victim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tagalos,&#8221; the girl cried out in sudden
alarm as she instinctively put her small
brother behind her, shielding him from the
flying bullets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil commanded
hoarsely as Phil started precipitously forward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
&#8220;We can&#8217;t stand them off, we&#8217;re too few.
Here we can make a stand if they attack us.
We can&#8217;t save the ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads saw at once the wisdom in O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s
advice. No power could save the ship from
the terrible onslaught of that savage horde.
The two vessels came together with a mighty
crash, and the air was rent with harsh cries
of triumph as the captors leaped on board, firing
their guns and slashing with their sharp
bolos. The cries for mercy from the cringing
crew were soon swallowed up in the shrieks
of pain and anger as the vengeful victors
satisfied their inherent love for blood.</p>

<p>The triumphant natives scaled the bridge
deck, and in the bright glow from the search-light,
the Americans were horrified to see
those on the bridge, in spite of their hands
held aloft in supplication, cruelly butchered
where they stood.</p>

<p>The Americans in mortal dread pressed
their bodies close within the deep shadow of
the boats. The blinding glare from the
search-light aided them in their attempt to
hide from the searching eyes of their assailants.
Phil and Sydney had manfully lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the native girl and her brother into the boat
behind them and stood their ground ready to
protect them with their lives. So this was to
be the end of their hopes for adventure?&mdash;to be
butchered, unarmed and in cold blood by a
band of lawless murderers.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>A POLITE CAPTOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Americans were not kept long in
suspense, although to the anxious boys,
huddled helplessly in the shadow of the boat,
the time seemed hours until the victorious
and jubilant natives moved aft, bent on annihilating
those whom they believed were hiding
from their search.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil grasped his weapon firmly, while
the lads made a mental resolve to seize the
arms of the first natives within reach and
sacrifice their own lives as dearly as possible.</p>

<p>Suddenly the beam of the search-light
swung directly aft, revealing to the pirates
the defenseless band of spectators to the
recent tragedy.</p>

<p>The helpless passengers were confident now
that all was over. As if in broad daylight,
they were visible to the outlaws. A volley
from their rifles would send them all to death.</p>

<p>Blinded by the bright light, they could but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
speculate as to the movement of their
enemies, but they well knew that they must
surely be advancing slowly, only awaiting
the word to throw themselves on their helpless
victims.</p>

<p>What could be done? Phil realized only
too vividly that something must be done and
quickly. A false move would condemn them
all. Once those wild men, steeped in the
blood of the innocent, had commenced, even
the power of their leader could not stop
them.</p>

<p>Then a girl&#8217;s voice, clear and commanding
from behind them, made the Americans gasp
in wonder. O&#8217;Neil with his great club raised
to strike the misty figures just beyond his
reach stiffened. The girl&#8217;s words were unintelligible
to the Americans, but to the advancing
natives they were like a flash of lightning
from out of a clear sky. They stopped short,
and for a few seconds a deep silence reigned.
The girl was speaking in her native tongue.
Phil cast a swift glance behind him; she
stood boldly upright in the bow of the
boat, like a beautiful bronze statue. The
light threw her face in high relief against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
black background of sky. He saw the flashing
eyes, the quivering straight nostrils, and
the scornful curve of her mouth. She
finished speaking, and still the silence was
unbroken. From the gathered crowd the
leader advanced, his hand held above his
head in mute sign of peace. Phil could
scarcely believe his eyes, but the girl&#8217;s low
voice in his ear caused his heart to beat
tumultuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has accepted your surrender.&#8221; She
spoke in Spanish. Then, with her hands
placed lightly on Phil&#8217;s shoulder she jumped
down to the deck and advanced to meet
the native leader. At a few paces from
her he halted, and the Americans held their
breath in wonder to see the bandit bow low
before her, raising her hand to his lips.
Then he turned and gave several harsh commands
to his followers, who quietly dispersed.</p>

<p>Inside of but a few minutes the lorcha had
disappeared in the night and the &#8220;Negros&#8221;
resumed its journey, the noisy engines chugging
away just as faithfully under their new
masters.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>The Americans, as they gathered about the
table to finish the meal long forgotten in the
excitement of the attack, marveled at the
outcome of the affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can she be?&#8221; Sydney whispered.
&#8220;Why, she orders the ladrone leader around
as if she were a princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was about to reply when the girl herself
appeared from the shadows, followed by
the native chief.</p>

<p>The lads regarded him with a mixture of
feelings, admiration for his soldierly bearing
and disgust at the thought of the wilful
butchery they had seen him permit on the
bridge of the steamer.</p>

<p>They recognized at once that these two were
of the highest caste among their people. The
man&#8217;s face, almost perfect in contour, except
in the cruel lines of the mouth, beamed hospitably
upon them.</p>

<p>The girl spoke quickly, breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Martinez wishes to meet the brave
Americans who would have fought unarmed
against overwhelming odds and who had no
thoughts of asking for quarter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Americans bowed, but the Filipino advanced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
his hand outstretched. Phil took it
with almost a shudder. Why had this hand
been withheld while the Spanish captain and
his officers were asking for mercy scarcely five
minutes before? Yet he knew that he had
no choice but to take the proffered fingers; he
and his companions were in the power of this
man, the lines of whose mouth told what
might happen if the native leader&#8217;s pride was
offended.</p>

<p>After shaking hands, Colonel Martinez went
straight to the point. &#8220;You belong to the
country of our enemy, and being such you
must remain prisoners of war. We shall land
at Dumaguete to-morrow, and if you will give
me your solemn parole not to bear arms
against us, I shall send you with an escort and
safe conduct to Palilo. If not, I must send
you to the headquarters of my superior,
General Diocno.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil as spokesman bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not give you our parole, colonel,&#8221;
he said emphatically. &#8220;We prefer to remain
prisoners of war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you will,&#8221; the insurgent answered
coldly, but his swarthy face betrayed his admiration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
&#8220;I shall assure you of my good
offices with our general. And now, I shall
leave you, but I warn you that your lives will
be in danger if you leave this deck, or if you
make the slightest attempt to thwart my
plans. I shall have your belongings brought
back here. You see I can take no chances,
and I appreciate that you three Americans are
no mean antagonists.&#8221; He cast a look of admiration
at O&#8217;Neil, who had been listening in
silence, his muscular fingers still clasping the
stout crowbar with which he would like to
have brained this pompous little Filipino.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beggars can&#8217;t be choosers, Mr. Perry,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil exclaimed with a wry smile after the
officer had departed, &#8220;and I guess it was a
good thing the girl knew how to get the ear
of that there little bantam rooster. In another
minute, I&#8217;d have brained one of them, and
then those words she spoke would have had
as much chance to be heard as the chairman&#8217;s
voice in a state convention.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Americans&#8217; belongings were brought to
them from their cabin by several evil-looking
natives, and very soon all were comfortable
under the awning, protected from the wind by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the boat against which an hour ago they had
been about to make their last stand.</p>

<p>The sun awakened the Americans at an early
hour the next morning. While they were
sipping their morning coffee, the lads gazed
in admiration at the beautiful scenery about
them. The little steamer had during the night
wound its way past myriads of small islands,
now but black smudges astern. The high
mountains of Kapay Island rose boldly from
the sea on their starboard hand. Ahead, becoming
more distinct, was the shore line
toward which the steamer was now traveling
at an increased speed as told by the more rapid
chugging of her engines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; Phil exclaimed as he cast a
glance toward the bridge, &#8220;something&#8217;s happening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney and O&#8217;Neil followed his gaze.
There on the bridge were Martinez and the
native pilot, who had apparently been spared
in the attack of the night before. Martinez
was walking up and down excitedly, casting
an anxious glance ever and again off on the
port quarter.</p>

<p>It was O&#8217;Neil who was the first to discover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the reason for the evident excitement of their
captors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoke,&#8221; he exclaimed laconically, characteristically
jerking his thumb toward the
islands astern fast being swallowed up in the
glassy sea. &#8220;They ain&#8217;t taking no chances.
That stretch of shore yonder,&#8221; he added, his
gaze on the shore line ahead, &#8220;must be the
mouth of the Davao River.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads gazed eagerly at the faint curl of
smoke astern, but it gave them but scant encouragement,
for it was only too evident that
before the stranger, if it were one of the many
small gunboats patrolling the islands, could
hope to get within gunshot of the &#8220;Negros,&#8221;
the steamer would have crossed the shallow
bar of the Davao River and be safe from the
pursuit of the deeper vessel.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could only stop her,&#8221; Phil lamented.
&#8220;Smash those rickety engines or haul fires in
the boiler.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil in answer cast a comprehensive glance
at the sentries on guard on the upper deck.
The evil-looking natives were squatted in
plain sight, their loaded rifles held tightly in
their brown fingers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;Oh! for three good Krag rifles,&#8221; Sydney
cried petulantly; &#8220;we could clear this deck
and then jam the steering gear there, and
by the time they could overpower us the
gunboat, if it is one, would make them
heave to.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a short time the girl and her brother
joined them, and the native guards arose and
moved farther away.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is one of your gunboats,&#8221; she announced
smiling mischievously at the evident pleasure
of the midshipmen; &#8220;Colonel Martinez has
recognized her through his telescope. She is
giving chase, but Dumaguete is now scarcely
twenty-five miles ahead, so I fear there will not
be a rescue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil calculated quickly. If Martinez could
see the gunboat with his glass to recognize her
she could not be over ten to twelve miles
astern. The &#8220;Negros&#8217;&#8221; best speed was ten
knots, which meant two and a half hours before
she could reach the river bar. He knew
that several of the gunboats were good for fifteen
knots. If this were one of the fast ones,
which he earnestly prayed it was, in two hours
and a half the gunboat would be up to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
&#8220;Negros.&#8221; His face brightened as these figures
awakened his hopes.</p>

<p>While the Americans went through the
pretense of breakfast the &#8220;Negros&#8221; steamed
swiftly toward the shore, and they saw with
rising hopes the white hull of a large vessel
raise itself slowly out of the deep blue of the
tropical sea.</p>

<p>Phil eyed the Filipino girl questioningly.
He could tell nothing from her sphynx-like
face. Would she be glad to be rescued from
this band of outlaws or was she at home and
safe among them? The respect shown her by
the leader and his men seemed to point to the
conclusion that she was of importance among
her people. He knew not what were those
crisp words spoken the night before to prevent
the fierce onslaught of the natives, but they
had calmed the storm. She had saved their
lives, that much was certain; and for that,
even though she was at heart in sympathy with
this band of pirates, he owed her his gratitude.</p>

<p>His whole heart rebelled against the thought
of captivity among the insurgents. He knew
it would be a living death. Poorly nourished
and without the necessities of life; exposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the savage temper of a people whose spirits
fluctuated more rapidly than a tropical barometer,
there seemed but little to live for. Perhaps
death would be happier! His thoughts
dwelt upon the stories he had heard of the
atrocities committed by this same Diocno
upon American soldiers who had been captured.
Some of them he had buried alive in an
ant-hill all but their heads, with their mouths
propped open and a train of sugar leading to
their swollen tongues. A cold shiver ran down
his spine as his imagination pictured the agony
of these men as they slowly died.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the &#8216;Albany,&#8217;&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cried joyfully a
minute later, &#8220;and do you see the bone in
her teeth? She&#8217;s making nearly twenty knots.
Why, it&#8217;s all over but the shouting. These
little yellow runts will look well when they are
lined up against the wall at Cavite and shot
for piracy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil held up his hand to demand silence
from the excited sailor. He did not know
how much English the girl might know, and
the ladrone leader might learn the dire wish
of the sailorman for him and his followers.
Then if the &#8220;Negros&#8221; escaped, his anger could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
be vented upon the Americans. But the girl&#8217;s
face did not betray that she had understood the
meaning of O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s words. The &#8220;Albany&#8221;
was fast approaching, but Phil knew that
O&#8217;Neil must be overestimating the cruiser&#8217;s
speed; the most she could make, without
special preparation, would be fifteen knots,
but, and his joy welled up into his eyes,&mdash;her
six-inch guns! He had seen them fired with
accuracy at four miles.</p>

<p>The shore line ahead had now become distinct.
The deep cut in the surrounding hills
betrayed the presence of the Davao River as
it flowed through them to the sea. Groves of
high-topped palm trees appeared, a deeper
green against the emerald background, while
the water stretching toward them from the
land polluted the sea with a dull brown
stain&mdash;the muddy water of the river. The
town of Dumaguete could not be seen, but
from the curls of rising smoke, Phil knew it
must be beyond the first bend of the river
and screened from view by the spur-like hill
stretching its length from the mountains behind
to the water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>The girl sat between the two midshipmen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
her small brother innocently unconscious
of the tragedy being enacted about him, playing
joyfully about the decks. Phil watched
the child as a relief to his overanxious mind.
He had dislodged a wedge-shaped block of
wood from under the quarter boat, and was
using it to frighten a large monkey which
was eying him grotesquely from on top of
the tattered awning. The monkey apparently
did not enjoy the game, for he suddenly flew
screeching at the boy, his mouth opened
viciously. The boy in his haste to escape
dropped the block of wood almost on Phil&#8217;s
foot and the midshipman determinedly placed
his foot upon it. In that instant an idea had
occurred to him. His pulse beat faster, as
the thought flashed into his mind. He
would use it as a last resort, even though it
would bring the howling mob of natives
vengefully about their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now she&#8217;s talking,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed
grimly, as a flash and a puff of brownish smoke
belched from the bow of the distant cruiser.
The Americans arose to their feet, their eyes
held fascinatingly on the cruiser. They
knew that a hundred-pound shell was speeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
toward them at a speed of a mile in three
seconds. The Filipino girl sat unconcernedly
sipping her coffee. She was as yet ignorant
of the meaning of that flash from a
vessel nearly five miles away.</p>

<p>Far astern a column of water arose in the
air and the distant shock of the discharge
came to their expectant ears.</p>

<p>Phil saw with sinking heart that the
&#8220;Negros&#8221; had entered the discolored water
from the river. Ahead less than two miles
the ever-present bamboo fish weirs showed
the commencement of the shallows of the
Davao River. His hopes died within him.
The cruiser was not making the speed he had
hoped. She would hardly be in range before
the &#8220;Negros&#8221; had put the high spur of land
between her and the enemy. The cruiser,
apparently seeing the quarry was about to
escape, opened a rapid fire in hopes of intimidating
or crippling its prey; but the
range was too great. The shells hissed close
to the stern of the fleeing vessel; the boasted
accuracy of American gunners was lacking.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she was only a thousand yards closer,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil cried in bitter disappointment. &#8220;It&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
only a matter of luck at this distance. Look
out,&#8221; he yelled as a shell struck the water
with the noise of an express train, within
fifty feet of the fleeing &#8220;Negros.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Filipino girl&#8217;s face blanched, while the
boy ran cowering to his sister&#8217;s side. The
danger to them seemed almost supernatural.
The girl&#8217;s lips moved, and Phil saw that she
was praying. For a moment a fear seized
him. The thought of their danger was certainly
unnerving. A single shell exploding
near them would send them all to eternity.
The fish weirs were now abreast the ship and
the &#8220;Negros&#8217;&#8221; bow was being guided into the
narrow, tortuous channel of the delta. The
Filipino pilot on the bridge spun his steering
wheel from side to side, following the twisting
channel. The quadrant with its rusty chain,
connecting the wheel and the rudder, clanked
loudly at Phil&#8217;s feet. Now was the time to
put his daring plan in operation. He saw that
the four guards had taken refuge behind the
boats, from which they peered out with frightened
eyes at the oncoming cruiser, dodging
out of sight at each screech of a shell. They
had apparently forgotten the prisoners whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
they were guarding, for their rifles and belts
were resting on the hatch several yards away.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I give the word, you jump for
those rifles and belts,&#8221; Phil said in a low,
intense voice, glancing covertly at the terrified
girl at his side. &#8220;I am going to jam the
steering quadrant. When you get the guns,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;take cover behind the boats.
It may cost us our lives, but anything is better
than imprisonment among these people.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil and Sydney breathed a gasping assent
to the bold plan. Phil watched carefully
the quadrant; he saw it move slowly over
until it was hard astarboard. He reached
down, grasping the boy&#8217;s block of wood under
his foot, then slid it slowly, amid the terrific
noise of a passing shell, toward the quadrant.
He knew the wedge would hold the rudder
over and the &#8220;Negros,&#8221; unable to steer, would
ground on the edge of the channel, thus leaving
her helpless to be captured by the cruiser.
He opened his mouth to give the signal for
his companions to act, when a shrill warning
cry sounded in his ears and he was roughly
drawn back into his chair and the wedge
dropped from his hands a foot from its goal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>A LEAK OF MILITARY INFORMATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier-General Wilson</span> sat at his desk
in the headquarters building at Palilo. In
the spacious corridors outside orderlies hurried
to and fro, carrying messages from the
several officers of the staff whose offices joined
that of the general.</p>

<p>Before him was a chart of his military district,
and while he pondered he juggled a
score or more of different colored pins with
little tags attached to them. Those pins with
blue heads represented soldiers of his command
in the field against the enemy while
the ones with the green heads were the ladrones
or insurrectos, whom he had been
fighting without success for nearly six
months.</p>

<p>&#8220;They jump about as if they were mounted
in balloons,&#8221; he exclaimed testily as he drew
out several green-headed pins and replaced
them in accordance with recent information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
in other localities on the map. The big headquarters
clock ticked away in silence, while
the gray-haired veteran again lapsed into
thought over his problem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are two regiments in the field,&#8221; he
complained querulously; &#8220;Gordon with two
companies at San Juan, Baker with a company
at Binalbagan, Anderson and a battalion
at Barotoc, Huse and a company at Estancia,
Pollard with two companies at Kapiz,
Shanks with three companies at Carles,
Stewart with his rough-riders at Dumangas
and Bane with his two battalions as a flying
column. That ought to give us some results,
and yet what have we to show for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The general raised his thoughtful eyes, as
his orderly&#8217;s step sounded on the soft matting
at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;A telegram,&#8221; he exclaimed with a show
of interest. &#8220;Tell Major Marble I wish to see
him,&#8221; he added, tearing open the yellow envelope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; he whistled in sudden consternation
as he read the unwelcome message.
&#8220;They not only avoided Gordon but attacked
San Juan in his absence, cutting up ten of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
men left to guard the town. This thing has
got to be stopped. There is a leak somewhere
and I am going to put my hand on it before
I send out another expedition.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed the chart back on his desk and
rose suddenly to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Major,&#8221; he cried as the adjutant-general&#8217;s
active figure entered the office, &#8220;we are all a
set of ninnies. Don&#8217;t start and look indignant,
sir,&#8221; he added in mock severity. &#8220;You
are as bad as the rest, but Blynn there is the
worst of us all, for he can&#8217;t do what he&#8217;s employed
to do&mdash;you and I are only plain, blunt
soldiers, while he is supposed,&#8221; with fine
scorn, &#8220;to be in addition lawyer and detective;
a regular secret service sleuth and all
that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, read that,&#8221; he ended throwing the
telegram on the desk. &#8220;You see it&#8217;s the
same old story, and ten more men butchered
through our stupidity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general paced up and down his office
with quick, energetic steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a good mind to go out in the field
myself,&#8221; he exclaimed, half to himself. &#8220;I
am tired of these silly, costly blunders.&#8221; Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
he glanced through the open door into the
next office to his own. &#8220;Come here, Blynn!&#8221;
he hailed.</p>

<p>A stout, dark-visaged officer arose from a
desk littered with countless papers and came
energetically toward him.</p>

<p>The older officer&#8217;s eyes roamed searchingly
over his judge-advocate general&#8217;s strong, massive
frame; he gazed with kindling eyes at
the bronzed cheeks, the unbending directness
of his black eyes, the firm set to the bulldog
jaws. Here surely was no weakling. He
waved his hand toward the adjutant-general,
standing in stunned silence, the telegram
crumpled in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;That may interest you,&#8221; the general exclaimed
as he turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The information was first hand, sir,&#8221; Captain
Blynn&#8217;s bass voice insisted after he had
straightened the paper and read the unwelcome
message. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a leak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course there&#8217;s been a leak,&#8221; the general
announced hotly, &#8220;any idiot would see that,
but where? Where? that&#8217;s the question!&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn returned to his desk and
drew out a bundle of papers from a locked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
drawer. He glanced over them hurriedly.
Every word was familiar to him. Could he
have made a mistake? Every witness whom
he had examined had given the same information.
These natives had not been coerced;
they had come to him of their own volition.
Espinosa had vouched for each. Then he
stopped, the papers fell from his hand to the
desk. No! it could not be possible! Espinosa
was surely loyal. That much was sure.
For the space of a minute he was lost in
thought. &#8220;I shall test him,&#8221; he muttered,
while he pressed a bell at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Se&ntilde;or Espinosa over the telephone
that I shall call on him in an hour on important
business,&#8221; he instructed the orderly who
answered his summons.</p>

<p>An hour later Captain Blynn mounted the
high stairs of the wealthy Filipino&#8217;s dwelling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buenos Dias, El Capitan,&#8221; Se&ntilde;or Manuel
Espinosa cried delightedly as he pushed a chair
forward for his visitor. But the smile died
quickly on the native&#8217;s face as Captain Blynn
waved away the chair impatiently, almost
rudely, and in his typical way jumped into the
very midst of the matter in hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;Se&ntilde;or,&#8221; he exclaimed angrily, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
betrayed! Do you understand?&#8221; he cried menacingly,
his flashing eyes fixed on the crafty
face opposite him, while he shook his big,
strong fist before the eyes of the startled Presidente
of Palilo. &#8220;Betrayed, that&#8217;s the word,
and if I can lay my hand on the hound, I&#8217;ll
swing him to the eaves of his own house-top.&#8221;</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Espinosa was silent, his crafty, bead-like
eyes regarding closely the angry, excited
face of the judge-advocate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Gordon went on a wild-goose
chase, and when he returned he found the insurgents
had been in San Juan in his absence.
Ten soldiers, American men, were caught,
trapped, and butchered. The natives who
brought me the information were vouched for
by you and now you&#8217;ve got to prove to me that
you&#8217;re not a sneaking traitor!&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain&#8217;s words tumbled one after another
so fast that the little Filipino could grasp
only half their meaning, but the last could not
be misunderstood. His brown face turned a
sickly yellow, while his frightened eyes sought
instinctively for some weapon of defense from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
this terrible American, who was strong enough
to tear his frail body limb from limb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, se&ntilde;or capitan, is this your much-boasted
American justice?&#8221; he gasped in a
weak voice. &#8220;Am I then judged guilty without
hearing my defense?&#8221; His voice became
stronger as he proceeded. &#8220;Let us look over
this calmly,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;I, myself, have been
betrayed. In embracing the American cause,
I have made many enemies among my people.
I live constantly in fear of assassination.&#8221;
He stopped abruptly, his voice choking and
his eyes filled with tears of self-pity.</p>

<p>Captain Blynn had dealt with many different
classes of men in his twenty odd years of
service. He had been a terror to the ruffians
on the Western frontier where he had been
stationed during the several Indian wars.
The &#8220;bad men&#8221; had said when they had
found Blynn against them, &#8220;We might as
well own up&mdash;we can&#8217;t fool Blynn.&#8221;</p>

<p>But here was a case that baffled him. In
the hour before going to this house he had
after deep thought believed that after all
Espinosa was a traitor, and he had avowedly
intended to force him to confess his treason; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
now in spite of these resolves, the captain was
weakening. After all might not the Filipino
be innocent? At all events he would listen to
his defense.</p>

<p>Captain Blynn dropped his muscular hands,
which had been creeping menacingly toward
the thin yellow throat of the Presidente, and
sat down suddenly in the chair which the
native had previously offered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; he ordered harshly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
suspend judgment, but remember, if you
can&#8217;t prove your innocence, I&#8217;ll give you
water. Do you understand, water! I&#8217;ve never
given it, and I don&#8217;t believe in it, but if you
can&#8217;t show me how these men were butchered,
I&#8217;ll fill you up to the neck with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Espinosa wetted his lips with his tongue
and swallowed hard, but the captain by taking
the proffered chair had removed the
native from the terrifying influence of those
powerful twitching fingers which he had seen
ready to throttle him, and he, in proportion
to the distance away of the cause of his fear,
grew bolder.</p>

<p>&#8220;The se&ntilde;or capitan must know of my
sincerity,&#8221; he pleaded in a weak voice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
&#8220;Have I not taken the oath of allegiance to
the United States? Do I not know the
punishment for breaking that oath?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn nodded his head. &#8220;Go
ahead,&#8221; he commanded impatiently; &#8220;cut
that out, give me the unvarnished story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The information which I gave you and
which was sworn to by three witnesses came
from Juan Rodriguez,&#8221; Espinosa continued,
dropping his voice to a whisper and approaching
closer to the American. Then he stopped
and glanced covertly at his listener&#8217;s startled
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Juan Rodriguez!&#8221; the judge-advocate
general exclaimed half rising in his excitement.
&#8220;Then you believe that he has deliberately
furnished false information of the insurgents&#8217;
movements?&#8221;</p>

<p>While the two were talking a servant
brought refreshments, which the army man
waved impatiently aside. Espinosa helped
himself and as he did so he followed his servant&#8217;s
eye to a tightly rolled piece of paper
inside the salva. He drew it out hastily, unrolling
it in silence, feeling rather than seeing
the captain&#8217;s eyes upon him, then he read the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
few lines written therein. Here was a chance
to redeem his good name or at least save himself
for this time from the fierce American.
He asked a question in the native language
and received a monosyllabic answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is very important,&#8221; he exclaimed
suddenly turning to the American officer.
His voice was now joyful, full of confidence.
&#8220;Two hundred riflemen have landed at
Dumaguete from Luzon. To-night they will
be encamped on a hill near Banate. You can
attack them there before they can join Diocno.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn jumped to his feet, reaching
out for the paper; he took it, scrutinizing it
closely&mdash;then stuck it quietly into his pocket.
Espinosa held out a trembling hand, bent
upon regaining the note, but Captain Blynn
had turned away, picking up his hat and
whip from the table behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall myself go in command of this
expedition,&#8221; he announced gruffly as he
moved toward the stairs, &#8220;and I shall expect
you to accompany me, se&ntilde;or. We shall start
at sunset.&#8221;</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Espinosa feebly murmured his willingness,
and after waiting to see the burly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
figure of his visitor pass out through the
wide entrance, he turned and called for his
servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the messenger I will speak to him,&#8221;
he said as the muchacho noiselessly entered.</p>

<p>A moment later a ragged native stood
tremblingly before him, twisting his dirty
head-covering in his nervous hands.</p>

<p>Espinosa seated himself luxuriously in the
chair recently vacated by Captain Blynn.
He had now regained his old confidence and
cruel arrogance, while he fired question after
question at the uncomfortable native.</p>

<p>The Presidente sat motionless in his chair
long after his messenger had gone. His servant
came noiselessly into the room several
times but tiptoed away, believing his master
was asleep. But Espinosa was far from sleep,
his brain was actively at work. How could
he hold his position and yet remain undiscovered
to this terrible Captain Blynn? He
shuddered as he remembered those big hands
as they worked longingly to grasp his slender
neck. He was not a fighting man; the inheritance
of his father&#8217;s Chinese blood mixed
with the cruelty in the native strain qualified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
him only for plotting. Others could do the
fighting. His brain and cunning would furnish
them the means and opportunity. But
Rodriguez&mdash;he was too honest, and knew too
much; he stood a menacing figure in his path
as the leader of his people. He had, however,
set the train of powder on fire, and now he
would watch it burn. Once Rodriguez was
removed there were no others strong enough
to thwart him. Even Diocno bowed to his
superior sagacity. Then he could cast off this
halter that he felt tightening about his neck.
With Diocno and Rodriguez out of the way,
he could make terms with these childlike
Americans, and then with his fortune made
shake the dust of the islands forever from his
feet.</p>

<p>An hour before sunset he arose and dressed
himself for his ride, ordering his servant to
have his horse ready. The messenger had
three hours&#8217; start; that would insure the escape
of the Tagalos. Captain Blynn would
find that his information was true. He could
not blame him if the enemy had taken alarm
and fled. As for the other matter, if the
Americans would only arrest Rodriguez he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
would see that he did not interfere with his
cherished plans for power. As he buckled on
his English made leggings, he whistled gaily
an old Spanish air, one he had heard in Spain;
in his mind he saw the brightly lighted theatre,
the richly dressed people in the boxes. Some
day he would be rich and he would then be
able to recline in a gilded box and cast disdainful
glances at an admiring crowd.</p>

<p>His joy would have been indeed short-lived
and his castles in Spain would have fallen as
flat as the surface of the sea on a calm day if
he could have known that at that moment his
messenger was lying dead in the trail but half-way
to his destination, suddenly overcome by
the terrible scourge of the camp, cholera.</p>

<small>LANDED IN CAPTIVITY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> was too angry and humiliated to do
more than glare at the girl who had so cleverly
thwarted him in his daring plan to strand the
steamer. His companions had started to
spring toward the coveted rifles of their enemy,
but now they sank back into their seats and
hopelessly looked into the menacing muzzles
of these same rifles in the hands of the four
aroused sentries. The girl had risen to her
feet, her face flushed with excitement; she
raised her hand to the natives, motioning
them to put up their weapons.</p>

<p>Phil scrambled to his feet and sheepishly
dropped again into his chair. His breathing
was quick and his eyes dilated with suppressed
rage and mortification. At that moment he
could have quite forgotten his natural instinct
of gallantry and would have taken pleasure
in throttling this slight girl who had come
between them and freedom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;They would have all been shot,&#8221; she said
in quick accents of excitement. &#8220;You see I
can understand a little English. I could not
be a traitor to my own blood as long as I had
power to prevent it.&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer Phil gave her a look of loathing.</p>

<p>The girl recoiled under his menacing glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry for you,&#8221; she hastened to add,
&#8220;for now Colonel Martinez will have to keep
you closer prisoners, unless you give me your
word that you will not again try to prevent
the escape of the steamer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil shook his head savagely, his eyes on
the steering quadrant within easy reach of his
hand. The girl waited breathlessly for an answer,
then finding none was forthcoming she
gave a sharp command in her own language
and immediately the four sentries closed in
around the Americans, their rifles pointed toward
their prisoners.</p>

<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake, Phil,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
in an agony of doubt, &#8220;don&#8217;t be foolhardy.
We are absolutely in their power.
See,&#8221; he cried desperately, &#8220;the &#8216;Albany&#8217; has
stopped and sheered away. She has given up
the chase.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Phil realized that Sydney was right&mdash;nothing
could be gained by giving in to his rash
anger. He saw that O&#8217;Neil had dropped the
crowbar and had been led away by two of the
natives, going as peacefully as a lamb. However
his pride stood in the way of an outward
surrender, and instead of agreeing to make no
attempts to disable the steamer he arose and
moved away from the tempting steering quadrant.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Negros&#8221; had meanwhile threaded her
way among the dangerous shoals and was now
in the river; the cruiser had disappeared behind
the land.</p>

<p>A great crowd of natives ashore had witnessed
the escape of the steamer from the war-ship
and these lined the banks of the river
shouting joyfully as the &#8220;Negros&#8221; steamed
quietly to the bamboo pier in front of the
village.</p>

<p>As soon as the dock had been reached, the
girl dismissed the guards and the Americans
once more gathered about the breakfast table.</p>

<p>A few moments later Colonel Martinez, his
face wreathed in smiles, left the bridge and
joined them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;You are to be given the freedom of the
town,&#8221; he said as he took a cup of coffee from
the servant&#8217;s hands and sipped it gratefully,
&#8220;but I warn you if you attempt to escape you
will be shot, and even if you escaped, without
guides you would be lost in the jungle and be
killed by ladrones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil bowed his head in sign of submission.
They were certainly prisoners, without hope of
rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow morning,&#8221; Colonel Martinez
added, &#8220;we shall leave the village and
march inland. I have already sent to notify
our leader that I have successfully arrived. I
think for your own good it would be wiser
for you to remain on board here until we
start. I do not trust the temper of the
people. Americans are not just now in
favor.&#8221; He finished with an amused smile
on his face.</p>

<p>After their captors had left them, the three
terribly disappointed men sat bemoaning their
fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might just as well make the best of
it,&#8221; Sydney philosophically assured the
others. &#8220;There certainly isn&#8217;t any way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
escape that I can see. After all, we&#8217;ve been in
just as tight places and have come out of
them; we don&#8217;t make matters any better by
crying over spilled milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that girl hadn&#8217;t betrayed us,&#8221; Phil
moaned, &#8220;we would have been on board the
&#8216;Albany&#8217; this minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil broke in apologetically,
&#8220;it ain&#8217;t like you to be unfair to anybody,
most of all a woman. These are her own people&mdash;Colonel
Martinez must be a friend of
hers, or otherwise we wouldn&#8217;t have been living
to see the &#8216;Albany.&#8217; If she had only been
an ordinary native girl, these ladrones wouldn&#8217;t
have stopped and bowed and scraped and
then given us the freedom of the after deck of
the ship. No, sir, she&#8217;s a person of consequence.
She saved our lives and then afterward
she saved the lives of Colonel Martinez
and his band of cutthroats, for if they had
fallen into the hands of the crew of the
&#8216;Albany&#8217; they would have all been shot or
swung at her yard-arm. Seizing this merchant
ship and killing her captain is piracy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think O&#8217;Neil is right,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
patting the sailor on the back enthusiastically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
&#8220;The girl&#8217;s all right&mdash;I&#8217;ll take my
hat off to her every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was my own stupidity, I suppose,&#8221;
Phil declared, his face sobering slightly. &#8220;I
thought she was too frightened to know what
was happening; in fact I really didn&#8217;t believe
she would understand what I intended doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do you suppose she is?&#8221; Sydney
asked eagerly. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it queer she has never
told us her name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It probably wouldn&#8217;t aid us if she had,&#8221;
Phil replied; &#8220;she&#8217;s probably the daughter of
some rich Filipino, who holds a fat position
under our civil government. By the way she
talked when we first met her I thought she
was dead against war, yet she appears to know
and welcome these cutthroat Tagalos with
open arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you go, Phil,&#8221; Sydney admonished,
&#8220;unfair again. She has so far shown herself
willing to help both sides. In your heart,
when you&#8217;ve recovered from your disappointment
and humiliation at being handled so
roughly by a girl, you&#8217;ll see that she acted in a
way that was just to both the insurgents and
ourselves.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>The next morning at daylight the Americans
were up and dressed, ready for the march
with their captors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Martinez has secured enough
horses for you and your companions to ride,&#8221;
the girl told them as a half dozen small
Filipino ponies were led down to the end of
the wharf. &#8220;Your belongings will be carried
by natives whom he has secured, so I hope
you will not be put to too great hardships.
The soldiers are used to marching, but for
those unaccustomed to the country it is very
tedious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil thanked her not ungraciously. He
had during many hours of a sleepless night
brooded over the situation and had awakened
with much kindlier thoughts for this girl
than he had held the night before.</p>

<p>The Americans, with Colonel Martinez, the
girl and her brother rode at the head of the
long file of armed insurgent soldiers. As the
procession passed through the streets of the
town the natives gathered and gave excited
and enthusiastic yells of pleasure. Great
curiosity was shown as to the white captives,
but Colonel Martinez took precautions that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
they should not be disturbed by the evident
dislike of the people. Phil read hatred in
many eyes as they wended their way through
the curious crowds, and he quite believed the
insurgent colonel&#8217;s words that they would
not be safe among them.</p>

<p>The trail which they were following led
steadily inland, and constantly climbed above
the level of the sea. After a few miles had
been covered all signs of habitation disappeared,
the country was bleak and barren of
cultivation. At first they had passed through
groves of cocoanut, banana and many varieties
of tropical fruit trees and afterward the velvety
green of rice fields lay on either hand,
but now the earth was scorched and brown,
the high jungle bush lay thick on either side
of the trail. The Americans realized the
hardships of a campaign in such a country
against a wild and determined foe. They
had marched for about four hours without a
rest when a signal of warning was given from
scouts in front. The leader stopped, giving a
low order to a soldier at his elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Phil breathed, forcing his
pony forward eagerly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;ve seen something,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil whispered;
&#8220;probably a company of our soldiers
on a &#8216;hike.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Americans were ordered to dismount,
and a dozen riflemen quietly surrounded
them. Colonel Martinez spurred ahead while
the entire band dissolved in the jungle, leaving
the trail clear. Scarcely twenty feet
from the trail the Americans were roughly
seized, their hands secured tightly behind
their backs and gags were forced into their
mouths. They submitted peaceably. Suddenly,
scarcely fifty yards away, a column of
khaki-clad soldiers appeared marching down
the trail. Phil caught a glimpse through a
vista in the dense brush of these men, swinging
lightly along, ignorant of the presence,
so near them, of over two hundred armed
enemies. His pulse beat fast and his heart
seemed ready to burst within him. Were
these Americans walking innocently into an
ambush? He tried to scream a warning, but
he emitted no sound save a faint gurgle,
which his guards heard, and for his pains
struck him down with their knees until he
lay with his face pressed close to the prickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
earth. He could hear the tramp of shod feet
and an occasional snatch of a song. Once he
heard a sharp command in English and at
another time a jest which called forth local
laughter. It seemed an age since he had
seen the head of this column appear, and yet
the earth trembled under the tread of a multitude
of feet. Finally the sounds died away.
The soldiers had passed, and no attack had
been made. After a long hour of waiting
their guards brought out the Americans and
unbound their hands, taking out the cruel
gags from their mouths. Colonel Martinez appeared,
still mounted upon his small gray pony.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry,&#8221; he said politely, &#8220;but I
could not run the risk of detection. That
was Colonel Bane with two battalions of the
Seventy-eighth Infantry. I had been warned
that he was in the neighborhood. I was not
strong enough to attack him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil could have cried aloud at the utter
uselessness of this warfare. Their movements
heralded far and wide whenever a column
moved, in a country well-nigh impenetrable,
how were the Americans ever to put down
this ugly rebellion?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>At sunset the band halted and went into
camp. Phil saw that the site selected was a
strong one and one that could be easily defended
from attack if the attackers came by
trail, and there seemed no other way through
the impenetrable brush.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall remain here until my messenger
returns,&#8221; Phil overheard Colonel Martinez
say to the girl. &#8220;Will you wait until your
father sends for you, or will you accept an
escort from me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall remain here,&#8221; she said; &#8220;the morning
should bring my own people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly afterward the girl took her brother&#8217;s
hand and led him away to the part of the camp
that had been set aside for her own use, and
Colonel Martinez joined the disconsolate
Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;The se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; he said as he sat down on
the ground near Phil, &#8220;has told me of the
brave conduct of my prisoners, and I wish it
were in my power to set you free. I have
known many American navy men before this
war began and my treatment by them has always
been courteous and considerate. I have
the power to take your parole, and knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
the hardships which you must undergo as
prisoners among our soldiers I advise you to
give it. To-morrow morning you can be on
your way to Palilo.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was certainly a grave temptation, but the
midshipmen knew that in giving their parole
all hopes of taking part in the war would
vanish; and then, the insurgents not being recognized
as belligerents, the Navy Department
might even see fit to order them to break their
parole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; Phil finally replied.
&#8220;We shall take our chances as your prisoners.
We shall always remember your considerate
treatment of us, and if by the chances of war
the situation is reversed you can count on us
to repay our obligations to a chivalrous
enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you and your companions were to remain
in my keeping,&#8221; the Filipino answered,
a pleased smile on his face at Phil&#8217;s subtle
compliment, &#8220;I should have no concern, but
I must give you over to the mercies of General
Diocno; he is a Tagalo, and has known
nothing but war since his youth; he would
never surrender to the Spaniards, and for years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
a price has been upon his head; he is said to
be cruel to those who fall into his hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil shuddered at the frank words of his
captor. He saw in the earnestness of his face
that this gruesome information was being
given for the Americans&#8217; own good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friends,&#8221; the colonel continued,
&#8220;will doubtless attempt a rescue, and that will
only add to your danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Colonel Martinez had said good-night
Phil told his companions of the unpleasant
and disquieting reports concerning their future
captor, but nothing could shake O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s good
spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all in the game, Mr. Perry,&#8221; he said
philosophically. &#8220;They can&#8217;t do more than
kill us, and as we&#8217;ve got to die some day, it
might just as well be in Kapay as any other
place. But as long as we&#8217;ve got our senses
and our strong arms, there are going to be some
little brown men hurt before I give up my
mess number.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ve been trying to study out,&#8221; the
sailor continued, seeing the two lads still
silent, &#8220;is how all those American soldiers
could pass along that trail and not find out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
that this band of natives had just left it.
Where are all the old Indian fighters we used
to have in the army?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney both raised their heads, a
look of surprise in their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.
&#8220;Our trail must have been there;
the native soldiers all go barefooted and leave
but indistinct tracks on this hard soil, but our
pony tracks must have been in plain sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The solution is,&#8221; Phil broke in sadly,
&#8220;those men were volunteers, the Seventy-eighth
Infantry, the colonel said; there probably
wasn&#8217;t an old soldier among them. They
fight like demons when they see the enemy,
but are as helpless as children against a savage
foe skilled in woodcraft. If that had been a
battalion of regulars there&#8217;d have been a fight
and we would now be free, or,&#8221; he added with
an unconscious shiver, &#8220;dead there in the
jungle, for the native guarding me would
have been only too happy to stick his bolo
into me.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil had already rolled himself in his
blanket, apparently resigned to the tricks of
fate, and the midshipmen, realizing, after their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
long day&#8217;s ride in spite of their troubled minds,
that they were in need of rest, were soon comfortably
settled on the bundles of dry grass
given them to lie upon. As Phil dropped
into a troubled sleep, he was conscious of the
four native guards, pacing to and fro just
outside of ear-shot. These four men were all
that stood between them and liberty; for once
they had escaped, he felt confident that O&#8217;Neil
could be depended upon to follow the track of
those half a thousand soldiers who had
marched past so carelessly only a few hours
before.</p>

<p>After what seemed an incredibly short time,
although he had slept for hours, he awakened
with a start; sitting bolt upright, he gazed
quickly about him. A faint streak of light in
the eastern sky told him the night had nearly
passed. His brain, keenly alive, grasped for
a reason; what had stirred him to wakefulness?
All was quiet about the camp. The
guards were no longer on their feet, but he
could see their shadowy forms squatting on
the ground, their rifles in their hands. With
a disappointed sigh, for what he did not know,
he dropped back upon his bundle of straw,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
but he soon found he was too wide awake for
more sleep. He finally arose, stretching himself
as though just awakened, and by an impulse
which he was powerless to disobey,
walked slowly toward the guards. As he advanced
he saw with surprise that they did not
move. Stealthily he went on until he stood
over the nearest one, squatting naturally, the
butt of his rifle between his bare feet. The
guard was sound asleep. Farther on he saw
in the dim mysterious light of early dawn that
the other three were also silently sleeping,
their bodies propped up against the trunks of
the dwarf pine-trees. Phil&#8217;s heart beat fast.
Here was freedom within his grasp. He leaned
forward, seizing the rifle barrel of an unconscious
guard, drawing it slowly from his relaxed
fingers. The butt still rested between
his feet and as he slowly, steadily drew the
rifle toward him, the sleeping native&#8217;s body
settled itself inch by inch upon the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>HERE WAS FREEDOM WITHIN<br />
HIS GRASP</i></p>

<p>A twig snapped close by, sending the blood
coursing through his veins while his hand
shook from the sudden start. Terrified he cast
his startled eyes into the jungle behind him.
The dim shadow of a man stood scarcely a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
hundred yards away, silently watching him.
In the dim light the figure seemed of heroic
size. He retreated toward it and back to his
sleeping companions, the rifle clasped in his
hand. Then suddenly the silence was broken
by a volley of rifle-shots and the hiss of bullets
sounded everywhere about him. Stunned,
unable to explain the meaning of this, he
dropped to the ground and lay silent, his face
in the straw of his bed. The next second a
line of shouting, excited khaki-clad men
streamed past, firing their rifles as they charged
upon their hidden native foes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>CAPTAIN BLYNN MARCHES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> night fell, Captain Blynn led his battalion
of regulars from their barracks, across the
bridge and on to the trail leading to the northward
of Palilo. The American officer rode in
the lead, the Filipino Presidente at his side.
The soldiers behind him, eight full companies,
each under its own officer, swung along with
the long, untiring step of the American soldier.
They each knew that before the night
was over and the sun had lifted its fiery head
above the misty mountains to the eastward
twenty miles of rough trail must be covered,
and then they had been promised to be
brought face to face with an enemy whose
shadows they had chased during these many
long, tiresome months.</p>

<p>Espinosa, as he rode in silence by the side
of the big American, chuckled inwardly at the
fruitlessness of this expedition. &#8220;These childlike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
American dogs,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;they will
arrive in time to see the smouldering fires
where our men have cooked their morning
rice, while they will be high in the hills, looking
down on them derisively, and possibly
will fire a few shots at long range to show their
contempt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn&#8217;s restless gaze contemplated
his companion from time to time as the native
signaled the right trail. They were now in a
narrow defile between two hills that rose precipitously
to a height of over a thousand feet.
Captain Blynn, as he contemplated his surroundings
with a soldier&#8217;s eyes, drew his revolver
from its holster and laid it gently across
the pommel of his saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice place for an ambush,&#8221; he said in a
low, insinuating voice. &#8220;I suppose, se&ntilde;or,
you are prepared to stand before your Maker.&#8221;</p>

<p>The native shuddered. He saw only too
clearly the accusation and threat in this terrible
American&#8217;s words. If there was to be an
ambush, he knew nothing of it, but if a single
hostile shot was fired, he would pay the penalty
with his life.</p>

<p>The Filipino forced an uneasy laugh. &#8220;As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
far as I know, se&ntilde;or capitan, there are no insurgents
this side of Banate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For your sake, I hope you are right,&#8221; the
American replied. &#8220;As you see, I am taking
no chances. You are our guide; if you get
us into trouble, you pay, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn ordered a halt and called a
lieutenant from the leading company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take ten men, Simpson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
act as the point. If you are attacked, retreat
and fall back on the main body.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Simpson picked his men quickly
and disappeared quietly down the trail. Captain
Blynn watched them until swallowed up
in the darkness, and then set the long line in
motion again. Every soldier took, instinctively,
a tighter grip upon his musket, and
loosened the sharp sword bayonet from its
scabbard. Each knew that when &#8220;Black
Jack&#8221; Blynn took precautions there was reason
to scent trouble.</p>

<p>Half-way through the defile a guarded
whistle of warning came to Blynn&#8217;s ears from
the point. As one man the long column
halted; the soldiers&#8217; heavy breathing was distinctly
audible above the tremor of the metallic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
rattling of accoutrements. Each soldier
sought his neighbor&#8217;s face for a key to the
solution of the problem. Blynn, motioning
Espinosa to follow, rode silently forward. In
the trail a hundred paces ahead he saw Lieutenant
Simpson bending over a dark object.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Blynn asked in a harsh
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dead native,&#8221; Simpson answered shortly.
Espinosa was off his horse instantly; bending
down quickly he struck a match, illuminating
the native&#8217;s dead face. He started, turning
a sickly yellow. His heart stopped beating,
and his knees shook under him, but
Captain Blynn was too much occupied with
the silent figure to notice the peculiar behavior
of his guide. They turned the dead
man over, revealing the terrible havoc accomplished
in but a few hours by the tropical
scourge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor chap!&#8221; Blynn exclaimed. &#8220;Only
a common &#8216;Tao&#8217; stricken by cholera and dead
before he knew what had hit him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They moved the body off the trail, and
again the command was set in motion.</p>

<p>In the flash of the match Espinosa had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
recognized his messenger although his face
was horribly disfigured by his last mortal suffering.
He shuddered at the consequences of
this man&#8217;s death&mdash;Martinez would not get his
warning message and would fall into the trap
set for him. He, Espinosa, could never explain
his actions. He would doubtless pay
for this treachery with his life. But his cruel
mind was instantly made up as to his future
actions. He feared this American too thoroughly
not to take them to the place where
the Tagalos under Martinez were encamped;
above all else Captain Blynn must be made to
believe that he was sincere; all depended upon
that. Everything must be sacrificed for his
final great ambition. Martinez would not be
taken alive. That was a necessity, he would
see to that. Once he was killed his part in the
night&#8217;s expedition must remain a secret
among the Americans.</p>

<p>Casting from him his first fears he straightened
his slight frame and rode boldly, with
head erect, beside the American leader.</p>

<p>One hour before sunrise Captain Blynn
disposed his command in a single circular
line about the base of a high hill; its sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
were covered with a dense jungle while a
single trail led to the top.</p>

<p>Under the guardianship of Espinosa the
command moved forward, straight up through
the high clutching brush; the men were so
close to each other that their neighbors on
each side were always in sight. Captain
Blynn and one company marched fearlessly
up the trail. A few feet from where the
round top hill had been cleared he halted
and waited for the remainder of his men to
join him. His enemy&#8217;s camp was silent, but
his keen eyes could discern shadowy forms
lying prone on the ground. He searched for
a sentry, but no movement could be seen.
Were they all asleep, believing themselves
secure in their surroundings? No! there
directly in front of him he saw a white figure
standing upright beside a dark form on the
ground. This must be an officer, for the
native soldiers do not wear white&mdash;something
familiar in the pose and cut of the uniform
struck him. Could it be possible, was it a
navy uniform? At that instant the soldiers
on both sides reached the edge of the clearing.
As yet the enemy were unaware of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
presence. Not a moment must be lost; they
must attack at once. Firing his revolver,
Captain Blynn plunged forward, straight toward
the white-clad figure. Several of his
men passed him while he stopped to find
why the figure had thrown itself face downward
in the grass at the discharge of his
revolver.</p>

<p>The next moment he was shaking hands
with three almost tearfully joyful fellow
countrymen.</p>

<p>As soon as Phil realized that they were
again free his thoughts were for the Filipino
girl and her little brother. Was she in
danger? With the rifle he had taken from
the sentry in his hands, he rushed anxiously
in the direction that he believed she might
be found. He recognized some of her belongings
on the ground at his feet, but the girl
had vanished. Fearful at the thought of
finding them killed by his own people, he
sought her everywhere, repeatedly risking his
life as the terrified natives, finding themselves
trapped, flung at him with their long,
sharp knives or discharged their weapons almost
in his face. He gave them but little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
heed, not giving a thought to the reason why
he had not been killed, although a faithful
sailor at his elbow was the only tangible
cause. A score of times O&#8217;Neil had saved his
young officer at the risk of his own life.</p>

<p>A small group of struggling men on the
right near the edge of the jungle suddenly
caught his restless eye and desperately he
plunged downward toward them. On the
ground two men struggled in a death embrace,
while the girl and her brother stood
wild-eyed with fright, unwilling spectators to
the fierce duel. Phil gave a gasp of relief as
he stood beside the girl. The two combatants
uttered no sound save their sharp gasps for
breath while they struggled for supremacy.
Phil saw with wonder that the men were
both natives and then for the first time
realized that they were alone; no soldier was
within a hundred yards of them. Behind
them the soldiers were relentlessly, stubbornly
herding the natives into a mass of
flashing, frenzied humanity at the top of the
hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Colonel Martinez,&#8221; the girl gasped
seizing Phil&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Oh, save him, se&ntilde;or,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
he will be murdered.&#8221; Phil saw the other
native, by an effort almost superhuman, free
his right arm, and in it a bright blade flashed
in the dim light. The girl&#8217;s appealing face
looked into his for an instant, and the next
moment the lad had thrown himself between
the two men; seizing the hand with the
knife he bent it slowly backward, finally
wrenching it from its firm grasp. O&#8217;Neil
was beside him. The sailor caught the two
natives as if they had been fighting dogs and
held them for a second in his powerful arms
clear of the ground. Espinosa fell limply as
the sailor released his hold, and lay breathing
heavily, too exhausted for speech. Colonel
Martinez quickly regained his revolver, and
was immediately the man of action. He gazed
boldly at the Americans, his revolver held
menacingly, and the while edging slowly
away from his captors. Phil turned his eyes
to the figure on the ground and the angry
glare he received disconcerted him; the next
second as he looked about him he saw that
Colonel Martinez had gone; from the gloom
of the jungle he heard the rustle of brush
and caught a glimpse of misty forms. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
raised his rifle half-way and then lowered it.
In his heart he rejoiced that he had not
taken him prisoner.</p>

<p>In the next second Espinosa leaped toward
him. Phil was stunned by a stinging blow;
but before it could be repeated O&#8217;Neil interposed
and Espinosa had measured his length
on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did Colonel Martinez go?&#8221; Phil
asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil answered, his face as
solemn as that of a judge.</p>

<p>Phil smiled and put out his hand. The two
men exchanged clasps. &#8220;I believe he would
have done as much for us,&#8221; Phil said.</p>

<p>Before the sun had risen above the sea to
the eastward, the fight was over. But few of
the enemy had escaped. Asking no quarter,
fighting to the last man, they had died as they
had lived. Two hundred rifles were the
spoils of the fight.</p>

<p>Captain Blynn and the midshipmen were
seated after their victory on the bloody battle-field,
while the lads gave a hurried account of
their capture.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the grass a horribly disfigured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
face confronted them. It was Espinosa.
His cunning gave him counsel that he must
control his ungovernable temper. He could
gain nothing by accusing these Americans of
wilfully aiding Martinez in his escape. &#8220;I
am sorry to inform you, se&ntilde;or captain, that
Colonel Martinez escaped. These gentlemen
can tell you the details. I was about to kill
him. They doubtless had good reasons for
permitting him to escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn turned quickly to the midshipmen,
a surprised look on his face at the
words of his guide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this true?&#8221; he asked angrily.</p>

<p>Phil felt as he had before the court-martial
that had tried him for disobeying orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I alone am to blame, captain,&#8221; the lad
replied quietly, after an effort. &#8220;I saw these
two men on the ground and separated them,
seeing they were both natives. This man attacked
me afterward, so of course he was
knocked down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was Colonel Martinez! His capture
is worth far more than all these men and
rifles,&#8221; the captain exclaimed angrily, pointing
to the heaps of slain being laid side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
by side in the narrow trench dug by the
soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;He escaped,&#8221; Phil said, his throat dry,
but his eyes looking fearlessly into those of
the enraged officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to explain this, sir,&#8221; Captain
Blynn cried hoarsely, cutting short any
explanation. &#8220;You are under my command
here. If you have deliberately allowed this
man to escape, I shall prosecute you to the utmost
of my power, and you know the articles
of war sufficiently to understand the penalty
for such an unauthorized act.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was stunned; but his conscience had
acquitted him of all guilt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>THE &#8220;MINDINAO&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Blynn</span> rested his tired soldiers
until the cool of the evening and then the
march was begun back to Palilo, carrying
with them the spoils of the fight.</p>

<p>The judge-advocate general, in spite of the
complete victory, was not friendly to the
Americans whom he had rescued from a torturing
captivity. The escape of the Filipino
leader, Colonel Martinez, was indeed a severe
blow to his pride. Both Sydney and O&#8217;Neil,
while giving the officer their gratitude for
their deliverance, were hurt at his stern attitude
toward Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you allow him to escape?&#8221;
Sydney asked as they were riding side by side
along the back trail which the soldiers had
taken the night before.</p>

<p>Phil looked at his friend, a hurt expression
in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was armed,&#8221; Phil said quietly, a catch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
in his voice which he could not control, &#8220;and
I knew he would not be taken alive. I
couldn&#8217;t kill him,&#8221; he added, &#8220;before the
girl&#8217;s eyes, and there seemed no other way.
Something tells me that there is a strong
blood tie between those two. I can&#8217;t explain,
Syd,&#8221; he cried in confusion. &#8220;It may sound
sentimental, but the look in the girl&#8217;s eyes
when she realized what might happen made
me lower the muzzle of the rifle to the
ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney was silent. He believed implicitly
in Phil and if opportunity had offered he was
sure that he would have acted the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t you give Captain Blynn
your reasons for allowing this insurgent to
escape? You must see how he now views the
occurrence and a word from you would have
set matters straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden anger came into Phil&#8217;s face. &#8220;I
would have told him all, but you saw how he
cut off my explanation and arraigned me before
that despicable spy Espinosa. After that a
mule team couldn&#8217;t drag the story from me.
I&#8217;ll tell it in good time, but not to Captain
Blynn. Syd,&#8221; he added confidingly, &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
don&#8217;t like that fellow Espinosa&#8217;s looks. He
reminds me of a domesticated coyote. He
will bite the hands that feed him some day.
You see if he doesn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any use for these men who are
traitors to their own countrymen,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
joined in as he rode up alongside of Phil, the
trail having widened to allow three abreast.
&#8220;The soldiers tell me he is the white-haired old
boy with Captain Blynn. It was he that betrayed
the Tagalos. How he gets his information
no one seems to know. Did you notice,&#8221;
he asked suddenly, &#8220;the expression on his face
when I dragged him away from the insurgent
colonel? He wanted that man&#8217;s life the worst
kind, and the girl&#8217;s too, I guess. We&#8217;ve made
an enemy, Mr. Perry,&#8221; the sailor added decidedly,
&#8220;and one who won&#8217;t soon forget us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gave a mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind making that sort of an enemy,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but we shall have to keep our eyes
open hereafter, I suppose, for Se&ntilde;or Espinosa.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was broad daylight before the expedition
arrived in Palilo and after a formal parting
from the other Americans, which O&#8217;Neil described
as &#8220;the frozen mit,&#8221; the naval men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
separated from the soldiers and took the street
leading to the water-front. There in front of
the quartermaster&#8217;s depot they saw the gunboat
&#8220;Mindinao&#8221; moored snugly to the stone
jetty.</p>

<p>A wave of pride swept through Phil&#8217;s body
as he took in the trim outlines of his command,
one of which any lad would be proud
to be captain.</p>

<p>A score of curious faces peered at them from
the gunboat as they drew rein at the gangway
and dismounted.</p>

<p>An exclamation of surprised inquiry met
their ears from the quarter-deck of the vessel
and a second later Ensign Marshall was
wringing their hands warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if this isn&#8217;t luck,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I am
partly packed and there&#8217;s a steamer for Manila
this afternoon. But,&#8221; and he stopped, precipitously
gazing with frank astonishment at
their soiled and mud-stained uniforms, &#8220;where
did you come from? I expected you by boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the Chinese servants set before their
hungry eyes a tempting breakfast, Phil and
Sydney in turn gave Marshall the exciting incidents
of their journey from Manila. O&#8217;Neil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
meanwhile had turned forward and was at
once the centre of an admiring crowd of
sailors; his big voice and hearty laugh sounded
distinctly over the quiet water-front.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you aren&#8217;t the luckiest lambs I&#8217;ve ever
seen,&#8221; Marshall laughed admiringly; &#8220;you&#8217;re
a regular lodestone, the three of you. Everything
you touch turns to excitement. Now
I&#8217;ve been here for three months, most of the
time cooling my heels at the dock with no one
to talk to except a lot of hayseed volunteers
who haven&#8217;t even been to sea, and now you
come along and relieve me and I suppose,
&#8216;presto,&#8217; there&#8217;ll be something doing at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not until we can get a little sleep,&#8221;
Phil exclaimed, smiling at Marshall&#8217;s sincerity.
&#8220;I am sleepy enough to drop off standing up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Marshall said as he pushed back
his chair and arose from the table, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
finished packing in an hour, and then you
can read your orders and take command. I
don&#8217;t want to miss that boat, for she makes
easy connections with the transport for home.
Think of it, Perry, home! Doesn&#8217;t it sound
fine?&#8221; Then, seeing that the name had not
stirred his listeners to a great degree of enthusiasm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
he exclaimed, &#8220;Well, if you&#8217;d been living
by yourself for nearly a year and hadn&#8217;t
seen anything but these natives, home would
sound good to you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads were soon asleep in steamer chairs
under the quarter-deck awning, while Marshall
busied himself with his packing. The Chinese
servants moved about noiselessly and
with deft hands quickly filled the two open
trunks. Finally Marshall remade his toilet
and appeared spick and span in a fresh and
spotless white uniform.</p>

<p>Refreshed by even this short nap the midshipmen
opened their trunks, which had been
carried over nearly sixty miles of rough country
on the shoulders of stalwart native carriers,
and in an incredibly short time appeared
on deck as fresh in appearance as if they had
both stepped from the proverbial band-box.</p>

<p>A shrill whistle sounded on the gunboat
followed by the call, &#8220;Lay aft, everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men filed aft on the miniature quarter-deck,
lining themselves obediently on each
side, and there waited.</p>

<p>A smile stole irrepressibly to Phil&#8217;s face.
Here on board this tiny ship, scarcely a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
feet long and of a little over one hundred
tons displacement, the far-reaching navy regulations
were being carried out with as much
form and punctiliousness as they would be on
the biggest battle-ship.</p>

<p>In a graceful speech Marshall bade farewell
to his small crew and then he unfolded the
paper in his hand signed by no less a personage
than the admiral commanding the Asiatic
fleet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are, upon the reporting of your relief,
Midshipman Philip Perry, U. S. Navy, detached
from the command of the U. S. S.
&#8216;Mindinao&#8217; and will proceed immediately
to Manila, reporting your arrival, for passage
to your home, to the senior officer present.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as Marshall&#8217;s voice died away, Phil
began to read his own orders, which he had
kept safely pinned to the inside of his breast-pocket
during the last few exciting days.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are hereby detached from the U. S. S.
&#8216;Ph&#339;nix&#8217; and will proceed to Palilo, Island
of Kapay, Philippine Islands, and upon your
arrival assume command of the U. S. S.
&#8216;Mindinao&#8217; as the relief of Ensign Charles
Marshall, U. S. Navy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>For a moment there was complete silence,
broken in an instant by a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three cheers for Captain Marshall.&#8221;</p>

<p>From twenty-five strong chests the cheers
were given, while the happy man honored
blushed with pleasurable pride and manly
tears welled to his eyes. And then Phil&#8217;s turn
came to blush and look confused, and as he
said afterward, foolish, when the same loud
voice proposed, &#8220;Three cheers for Captain
Perry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately the cheering was over the
boatswain&#8217;s mate&#8217;s pipe sounded shrilly and
the men, touching their caps respectfully, returned
to their quarters forward.</p>

<p>The lads saw Marshall sail away on a small
island steamer similar to the one on which
they had commenced their journey four days
before and then returned to sit upon the quarter-deck
of their gunboat and enjoy the intense
gratification of being their own masters on
their own ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of it, Syd. If I want to get under
way all I have to do is to tell the machinist
to get up steam and off we go. It&#8217;s like having
your own yacht,&#8221; Phil exclaimed contentedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
leaning back luxuriantly in his chair
and cocking his feet up comfortably on the
rail. &#8220;Let me see,&#8221; he added banteringly,
&#8220;I am the captain; you are the executive officer,
navigator, ordnance officer, all the watch
officers and the chief engineer. Don&#8217;t you feel
heavy with all those titles?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney smiled happily. &#8220;Well, if the &#8216;old
man&#8217; doesn&#8217;t expect too much of a poor midshipman,
I&#8217;ll do my best to uphold the dignity
of them all,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>After they had settled themselves in their
new homes and had inspected every foot of
the clean, trim little craft, admired the powerful
battery of six long three-pounder guns, with
auxiliaries of two one-pounders and a much
sinned-against Colt gun, they started over the
gangway bent upon paying their respects to
the general commanding the troops in the
military district of Kapay.</p>

<p>It was with a decided feeling of uneasiness
that Phil sent his card by the orderly to the
general. He knew that Captain Blynn had
before this given his superior officer a full account
of his expedition and he felt sure that
the escape of Martinez with his consequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
blame had not been forgotten in the telling.
However, his high spirits could not be easily
dampened by even these sinister thoughts.
His greatest ambition had been achieved.
Was he not the commander of an American
man-of-war? He was not even under the
command of that awe-inspiring figure he could
see dimly at the desk, on whose shoulders the
direction of an army rested.</p>

<p>In spite of this feeling of independence the
lad&#8217;s pulse beat faster as the orderly beckoned
him to enter the general&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>A short, sharp-featured officer, whose hair
and beard were as white as his spotless clothes,
arose from his chair and gave a welcoming
hand to the visitors in turn, inviting them in
silence to be seated.</p>

<p>Phil fidgeted restlessly in his chair, while
the general paced slowly toward the open
window and back again to his desk. Phil
was on the point of speaking several times,
but each time he waited, seeing in the army
man&#8217;s face that he was about to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Blynn has made his report,&#8221; came
in metallic tones from the old campaigner,
&#8220;and I am deeply distressed to hear that you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Captain Perry, deliberately allowed a prisoner
to escape; one whom above all I wished to lay
my hands on. Blynn is for asking the admiral
to court-martial you at once; but I am sure you
must have some good reason for your action.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ended and glanced questioningly at the
abashed Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;My reason was,&#8221; the lad blurted out, his
feelings much hurt at the severe arraignment,
&#8220;that in order to capture Colonel Martinez, I
would have had to kill him in cold blood. I
couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it for he had behaved
handsomely toward us while we were
his prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; the general retorted, &#8220;Se&ntilde;or Espinosa
would have saved you the trouble if you had
not interfered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s wrath blazed forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did I know that the man who was
about to murder Martinez was a traitor to his
own people? I saw the two natives on the
ground, one with a knife upraised to bury it in
the body of a man lying helplessly beneath
him, and then when I had separated them
with the help of a sailor, I saw that Martinez
was armed, and I knew by a glance at his face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
that he could not be taken alive.&#8221; The lad
stopped suddenly, the girl&#8217;s face coming suddenly
before his eye. Did the general know
of her? He remembered that her presence at
the scene had not been mentioned. Had
Espinosa failed to discover her presence? If
not, why had he failed to mention her in his
report to Captain Blynn?</p>

<p>General Wilson&#8217;s parchment-like face betrayed
a suspicion of a smile while he listened
patiently to the midshipman&#8217;s impetuous defense
of his own actions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Perry,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;after
you have been fighting these natives longer
your sensibilities will become more blunted.
The excuse of allowing an enemy to escape
simply because you did not wish to kill him
would be laughed at by those who have been
through these six months of fighting. But,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;I respect the delicacy of the situation
and shall tell Captain Blynn that I approve of
your actions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s gratitude was fully expressed in the
look he gave the officer as he murmured his
thanks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish you to believe,&#8221; the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
added hastily, &#8220;that I approve of useless bloodshed,
but in a warfare such as has been forced
upon us the higher instincts of generosity to a
fallen foe have but small place. It is an eye
for an eye with us now.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the general finished speaking the adjutant-general,
Major Marble, entered and
greeted the newcomers warmly. Both the
lads had known him in their Annapolis days.</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Marble will give you the situation,&#8221;
the general said as the midshipmen shook his
hand in parting. &#8220;I suppose you are ready to
get under way on summons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil answered promptly in the affirmative.</p>

<p>The major took the lads to his own comfortable
quarters, facing the Plaza, and then told
them briefly of the perplexing conditions
under which the general was struggling.</p>

<p>&#8220;The insurgents will only fight,&#8221; the major
told them earnestly, &#8220;when they can surprise
us, and with these untrained volunteers that
has been very frequent of late.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen told him how the American
troops had marched unsuspectingly past
Colonel Martinez&#8217;s party the day before Captain
Blynn attacked them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>Major Marble shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Bane is not a soldier and never
will be. He has blundered into more traps
than any officer in the island.&#8221;</p>

<p>A heavy footfall sounded on the stairs.
Major Marble stopped talking suddenly, and
walked quickly to the door as Captain Blynn&#8217;s
stalwart figure emerged from the stairway.
&#8220;Come here, Blynn,&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>The judge-advocate general approached;
upon his face was a good-natured smile which
changed suddenly to an ugly frown as he
caught sight of his brother officer&#8217;s guests.
He would have turned sullenly away, but
Major Marble put out a restraining hand.
The lads had risen to their feet. Phil felt his
own face suffuse with blood as he caught the
glint of annoyance in Captain Blynn&#8217;s eyes.
The midshipman turned his back quietly and
looked out the window. A moment later he
heard the captain&#8217;s heavy tread in the hall
and a door slam loudly. When he turned
Major Marble&#8217;s face was pale and his blue eyes
flashed angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blynn&#8217;s a boor, sometimes,&#8221; he hastened
to apologize. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard the story. He&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
so absorbed in his work that any one who
thwarts him arouses his dislike. He cannot
see the human side. He&#8217;s a veritable bull in
a china shop. He and Espinosa are doing
splendid service. All of our success so far
has been through their secret service work.
You&#8217;ll be friends after you&#8217;ve been here
a while. Martinez&#8217;s escape hurts his pride just
now. Martinez is something like the man
with the iron mask. He comes from Luzon,
but no one knows who he is. We have wired
Manila and they answer that they know of
no insurgent officer of that name. Yet he&#8217;s
here, and from all accounts has been expected.
Most of his party were destroyed by
Blynn, but about seventy-five are believed to
have escaped, and Espinosa says that his followers
are landing every day in the neighborhood
of Dumaguete. I think the general&#8217;s
plan is to have you cruise off there in hopes
of intercepting some of their war parties.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had composed his ruffled feelings and
listened eagerly while Major Marble was talking.
His heart sank within him as there
flashed through his mind thoughts as to
whom Martinez might be. Maybe no less a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
personage than Aguinaldo himself, or General
Rios, had been within his grasp. Small wonder
that Captain Blynn was put out at his
escape. Yet he could not have done otherwise
with the girl&#8217;s beseeching, pleading eyes
upon him.</p>

<p>After leaving Major Marble&#8217;s quarters the
lads took a turn around the small Spanish
town, loitering before the many shops and
gazing admiringly up at the great churches,
gray with age. They finally hired a carramata,
the native cab, and drove through the
city and out on the military road, begun by
the Spaniards years before but, as was the
custom of the country, never finished. As
they drove into the Plaza on their return
they came face to face with Se&ntilde;or Espinosa,
riding a blooded horse which was prancing
and pawing the earth, and making vain attempts
to unseat its rider. Espinosa drew
rein and bowed pointedly and courteously to
the Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;ores,&#8221; he called eagerly, &#8220;may I have
a word with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil ordered his cochero to stop, while
Espinosa dismounted, throwing his reins to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
small native gamin near by. The native advanced
to the carriage hat in hand and with
as much ceremony as if he were about to
speak to some exalted personage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am extremely mortified at my actions
of yesterday,&#8221; he exclaimed in his fluent and
grandiloquent Spanish. &#8220;I have just seen
the general. I abjectly apologize for my
rudeness. May I count upon the friendship
of the se&ntilde;ores?&#8221; he asked in a suave, appealing
voice.</p>

<p>Phil flinched unconsciously. He felt as if
some reptile was drawing him toward him
against his will. Espinosa&#8217;s eyes were mild
and his smile was urbane; yet he felt that
treachery was hidden behind this mask of
friendliness. Espinosa read the struggle in
the lad&#8217;s eyes and for an instant the mildness
died in his own and a savage gleam took its
place, but Phil&#8217;s gaze had wandered, and this
vision of the true man was lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t bear you any ill will for that,&#8221;
Phil replied, his voice unconsciously accenting
the last word. &#8220;I suppose you felt you
had been cheated of your victory over Colonel
Martinez.&#8221; Then the lad stopped suddenly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
a question trembling on his lips. Why should
he not ask it? Wherein was the harm?
&#8220;Who was the girl with him?&#8221; Phil suddenly
questioned.</p>

<p>Espinosa&#8217;s face paled and in his eyes fear
crept. &#8220;The girl,&#8221; he gasped, &#8220;was there a
girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded. &#8220;Yes, and her small brother;
they came on the steamer with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And escaped with Martinez,&#8221; Espinosa exclaimed
excitedly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see her; it was
too dark. While I was struggling I thought
I heard a woman&#8217;s scream, but afterward I
saw only Martinez.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil saw the native was unduly agitated.
What did it mean? How and why had the
presence of this woman so greatly excited
him?</p>

<p>As the midshipmen drove toward their
ship this question was still in Phil&#8217;s thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Espinosa playing a double game?&#8221; he
asked Sydney suddenly. &#8220;Does he fear detection
by his own people? Does he believe that
Martinez did not recognize him and that his
identity as a traitor is safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney shook his head over the mystery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>THE GUNBOAT CO&Ouml;PERATES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the two midshipmen stepped over the
gangway of the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; a figure arose
from a seat on the quarter-deck and hurried
eagerly toward them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting an hour for you,&#8221; Major
Marble exclaimed excitedly. &#8220;The general
wants you to start as soon as possible for
Binalbagan. Baker&#8217;s men have had a fight;
we got some news, and then the wire was cut;
our signal corps men have already gone out to
find the break. Tillotson and fifty men will
be on board inside of an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen&#8217;s eyes opened wide with
excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting up steam, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
volunteered. &#8220;I thought something was in
the wind when I seen the major come aboard,
so I asked him and he told me what we was to
do.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>&#8220;Good for you,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, throwing
an appreciative glance at the trusty boatswain&#8217;s
mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baker is in the field and a sergeant and
twenty men are holding the post,&#8221; Major
Marble continued, &#8220;but if the natives are in
great force such a handful cannot last long.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later, Lieutenant Tillotson, a thin,
blonde-haired youngster, marched his khaki-clad
men on board and joined the little group
of officers about the table on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>Phil gave the young soldier a look of close
scrutiny as he unbuckled the revolver from
about his slim waist and laid it on the hatch
top. There was nothing soldierly in the newcomer&#8217;s
appearance, and Phil unconsciously
gave a sigh of disappointment. On the officer&#8217;s
collar between the crossed rifles was a
single numeral.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a regular, too,&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck,&#8221; Major Marble cried as he
passed over the gangway on to the dock while
the gunboat heaved up its anchor from the
muddy bottom of the river and steamed swiftly
for the outer harbor.</p>

<p>Phil studied carefully the chart in his miniature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
wheel house forward. &#8220;Ninety miles,&#8221;
he mused as he stepped off the distance to
Binalbagan. &#8220;At this speed we&#8217;ll be in by
daylight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three sat long over their dinner on the
cool quarter-deck, while the gunboat sped
rapidly along the coast of Kapay. Forward,
the soldiers and sailors fraternized, speculating
upon the morrow&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>The naval men&#8217;s faces were keenly excited.
The long-looked-for fun had commenced.
They were almost willing to hope that Captain
Baker&#8217;s men were having a stiff time of it, so
that the guns of their boat could have a chance
to speak their disapproval to the insurgents.
Lieutenant Tillotson sat coolly contemplating
his coffee cup. To him these expeditions
meant but one thing: discomfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the chance for a fight?&#8221; Sydney
asked the army man.</p>

<p>Tillotson shook his head. &#8220;None,&#8221; he
replied, &#8220;unless we can catch them by surprise.
This gunboat would scare off an army of insurgents.
They don&#8217;t like them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we shall surprise them,&#8221; Phil cried
enthusiastically. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get there before daylight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
hit the enemy from behind and crumple
him up. I dare say, though, the fight will be
finished before we arrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tillotson shook his head. He was non-committal.
&#8220;News travels fast in this country,
and it&#8217;s only twenty-five miles by road to
Binalbagan,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been there?&#8221; Phil asked, all interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Tillotson replied carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your plan?&#8221; Phil inquired
quickly.</p>

<p>Tillotson eyed the lad, his blue eyes wide
with astonishment, while a superior smile
curved the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plan?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Why, just to land,
that&#8217;s all; isn&#8217;t that enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but,&#8221; Phil urged, &#8220;it&#8217;ll be dark, and if
fighting is going on, we may get between the
two fires. I got myself in that fix once, and I
know how it feels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tillotson&#8217;s eyes opened wider. He took a
closer look at this young midshipman.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he know of being under fire?&#8221;
he thought. Tillotson was a first lieutenant;
he had served in Cuba and in the Philippines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
but his active duty until his assignment to
the regiment whose number he now wore on
his collar had been only at a desk at headquarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;What service have you seen?&#8221; he inquired
of Phil in a patronizing voice. &#8220;Were you
in the battle of Santiago, or Manila Bay, perhaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;not those,&#8221; Phil answered quickly,
awe in his voice; &#8220;only a few skirmishes, that&#8217;s
all,&#8221; he added sheepishly, &#8220;in South America
and in China.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have we then had trouble in those places
recently?&#8221; Tillotson inquired in mild surprise,
and in a voice calculated to annoy his
listeners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very lately,&#8221; Phil answered; &#8220;the
South American trouble was over a year ago
and in China about six months ago. They
were only small rumpuses. I dare say you
didn&#8217;t hear about them.&#8221; Phil&#8217;s pride was
touched, for he knew that many papers had
given full and even exaggerated accounts of
both fights, and his name and Sydney&#8217;s had
been glowingly mentioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I must have been out in the field<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
at the time,&#8221; Tillotson explained indifferently,
&#8220;so I didn&#8217;t see the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we best make up a plan of just
how we&#8217;re going to do this thing?&#8221; Phil
urged, returning to his point and being guided
by his training at the Naval Academy, which
had taught him to be methodical in all things.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tillotson regarded the lad coldly.
&#8220;You can plan for yourself,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been fighting these insurgents for some months
and my men know my plans by heart: they
comprise just one word: &#8216;Forward.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>After the lieutenant had gone to his cot and
was sound asleep, the midshipmen adjourned
to the brightly lighted chart house to discuss
the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;This rank business is what is hurting the
army and navy too,&#8221; Phil exclaimed testily.
&#8220;Just because a man has one more stripe on
his sleeve he thinks he knows more than
every one below him, and considers a suggestion
from a subordinate unpardonable insubordination,
almost akin to mutiny. Well,
Mr. Tillotson can keep his own plan, but, Syd,
I am going to work out our end of it.&#8221; While
Phil spoke he drew the chart toward him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
glanced carefully at the land in the neighborhood
of Binalbagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see that marsh behind the town?&#8221;
he exclaimed suddenly to Sydney whose eyes
were upon the chart. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably mangrove,
and they can&#8217;t get through that, so if
they&#8217;re attacking, it&#8217;ll be from the side. If
Tillotson lands his men to the northward and
we take a position to the southward we ought
to make a big haul. I told O&#8217;Neil to have the
Colt gun ready and if it comes out as I hope
it will, we&#8217;ll land it there,&#8221; pointing to a spot
on the chart showing a low hill to the left of
the town.</p>

<p>Sydney agreed heartily with Phil&#8217;s plans,
and berated soundly the attitude of the army
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; Phil said in apology for him
as they parted, one to turn in, the other to
keep watch until midnight, &#8220;that he&#8217;s had so
much fighting he&#8217;s grown careless.&#8221;</p>

<p>At midnight Phil was awakened, and relieved
Sydney on the bridge, while the latter
went below to get a few hours&#8217; sleep before he
would be needed in the work to be accomplished.
Phil gazed through the darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
ahead of the gunboat; the dim outline of the
land along which they were traveling could be
seen on the port hand. The coast was bald
and he knew he could without danger run as
close as he desired to its precipitous cliffs.
The more he thought of the scornful carelessness
of the young lieutenant the angrier he
became. What right had he to consider such
an expedition one to require no plans? What
if he landed in an ambush?</p>

<p>&#8220;He should consider the lives of his men,&#8221;
he exclaimed hotly.</p>

<p>The midshipman already knew that a large
part of the garrison were not at Binalbagan,
having gone on an expedition to the north
coast; a sergeant and twenty men had remained
to guard the men&#8217;s barracks and supplies, to
say nothing of the natives who had professed
friendship to the Americans and lived close
under their protection. These poor souls,
Phil knew, were between two fires; if the soldiers
were defeated they would be killed by
their enraged countrymen, while if their countrymen
claimed and received aid from them
they would at once be put in prison by the
Americans, and yet if they refused to subscribe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
to the cruel demands of the insurgents their
lives would pay for their rashness as soon as
they wandered outside of their village.</p>

<p>He paced restlessly the silent bridge. His
men he could see sleeping under the awning
just below him. The man at the wheel, his
eyes on the compass, and the lookout on the
forecastle were alone awake and alert. The
hours dragged by. A faint blush of dawn
was visible on the eastern horizon when Phil
through his powerful night-glass could recognize
the chief landmark near the town of
Binalbagan, a deep notch in the rugged coast
hills through which the river in the season of
rains flowed to the sea. It was as yet too
dark to discover the town, and Phil knew
that the hull of the gunboat could not be seen
from shore until the sun had almost risen
above the horizon. The last point of land
was rounded, and the gunboat&#8217;s bow was directed
toward the locality where he knew the
town was even then in the throes of an attack
from a savage enemy. His heart rose in his
throat as his mind dwelt upon the gruesome
possibilities if the handful of soldiers had been
overpowered by their numerous foe. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
almost with a sigh of relief that, as the gunboat
approached nearer the shore, he indistinctly
recognized the faint flashes of flame
from rifle fire. At least the soldiers, or some
of them, were still alive.</p>

<p>All hands had been called, and on the deck
of the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; there was a scene of great
activity. Boats were cast loose and supplied
with the accessories of war. A grim Colt gun
was mounted on its tripod ready to be carried
ashore to hurl its five hundred shots a minute
at the foe.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tillotson, after a rapid inspection
of his men, approached the two midshipmen
on the bridge. Phil had slowed the
gunboat. With a leadsman in the chains,
calling out the depth of water, he was now
steering directly for the small, serpent-like
flashes showing distinctly against the dark
background of the hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like a big fight,&#8221; Phil exclaimed
excitedly as the lieutenant reached his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;These people make a lot of noise,&#8221; the
latter replied nervously. &#8220;I am not afraid
of their rifles; the bolo is their weapon. By
Jove!&#8221; he exclaimed, after taking another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
long look at the scene. &#8220;It is a big fight.
I&#8217;d no idea they had so many rifles on the island.
My fifty men won&#8217;t be a drop in the
bucket.&#8221; He turned upon Phil, alarm in his
eyes. &#8220;I shan&#8217;t land under that fire. Our
men are doubtless intrenched in the convent
and can hold out till daylight, then when it
gets light enough to see, you can easily drive
the insurgents off with your guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gazed at the army man in undisguised
surprise. What did he mean? Was this the
same Tillotson whose only order was &#8220;forward&#8221;?
Here they were, undiscovered, with
fifty soldiers, a Colt gun and a gunboat. It
was a chance a landing party seldom had to
deal its enemy a severe blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be five hundred riflemen surrounding
the town,&#8221; Tillotson continued, with
more assurance, believing from Phil&#8217;s silence
that he had agreed with his plan of attack.
&#8220;It would be foolhardy to risk my men against
such odds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He does think of his men, then,&#8221; Phil
thought contemptuously.</p>

<p>The gunboat had now stopped and lay motionless
on the quiet sea. Without orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
four boats fully manned with ready sailormen
were noiselessly lowered from the davits.
Stalwart arms lifted the Colt gun and placed
it in the bow of a cutter. Phil gave a last
careful search through his glass at the shore
line, scarce a thousand yards away. He
could see the shadowy form of the big white
cathedral from which tongues of flame darted
incessantly. To the right the long, low
convent building was silent. The soldiers
had seized the church and inside its shelter
they were making their last stand. Phil was
assured that they would be safe until their
ammunition was exhausted, and his experience
had taught him that soldiers in such
straits, unless there was an officer to control
them, would use up their last cartridge before
thinking of the dire consequences. To
husband ammunition was not their concern.
Even as the lad gazed the enemy&#8217;s flashes appeared
closer to the cathedral. They were
closing in; a final rush might land these
savages under the very walls of the church.
His hand shook violently and almost a sob
escaped him as a bright flame suddenly appeared
on the convent roof.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;They have set the convent on fire,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed in an awed whisper. Then he
turned fiercely on the army man.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your plans now?&#8221; he asked
almost roughly.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tillotson drew himself up
stiffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;At sunrise all will be clear,&#8221; he angrily
insisted. &#8220;It would be worse than murder
to land now; as you said last night,&#8221; he
added, seemingly grasping at a straw, &#8220;we
would be between two fires.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gave him an impatient glance. &#8220;Come
on, Syd!&#8221; he exclaimed eagerly, leading the
way down from the bridge.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil had his four boats ready at the
gangway; two for the soldiers and the others
for the men of the gunboat who could be
spared from the guns.</p>

<p>The lads gripped each other&#8217;s hand in
silence as Phil stepped on the gangway ladder
leading to the boat. The soldiers by one accord
had crowded aft, their rifles in hand
and cartridge belts bulging with extra ammunition.
Some had even filled the inside of their
blue flannel shirt with more precious cartridges.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we going, sir?&#8221; the sergeant
asked, gazing through the darkness for his
lieutenant.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head. He was too angry to
speak. Then suddenly without command the
soldiers filed, at first hesitatingly, casting
anxious glances behind them, into the awaiting
boats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd,&#8221; Phil said in a low, tense voice,
&#8220;you know the plan. Keep those cordite
shells away from our own men. Get as close
in as you can; don&#8217;t hesitate to run her
ashore if necessary. If I am not mistaken
we&#8217;ve got these natives in the closest box
they&#8217;ve ever been in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The four boats waited in silence at the
gangway. Phil had taken his place with
O&#8217;Neil in the boat carrying the Colt gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Lieutenant Tillotson we&#8217;re ready,&#8221;
Phil said in his natural voice to Sydney on
the gangway.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tillotson strolled aft slowly,
his eyes on the streak of dawn ever increasing
in the eastern sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Tillotson,&#8221; Phil said harshly;
&#8220;we&#8217;ve wasted too much time already.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Lieutenant Tillotson stopped on the gangway
and glared angrily at the composed midshipman
below him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know,&#8221; he sneered, &#8220;what
business a midshipman has to give orders to
his superior officer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you one more chance, Tillotson,&#8221;
Phil said in a stern, tense whisper; he did
not wish the men to hear. He could see
even in the dim light the surprised, incredulous
look on the faces of his sailors.
&#8220;Will you please get aboard?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant remained motionless, a dark
scowl on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shove off,&#8221; Phil ordered harshly.</p>

<p>The boats cleared the gangway. The sailors
dipped their oar blades, ready to follow the leading
boat in which was Phil and the trusty Colt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back here,&#8221; the lieutenant cried,
seeing he had gone too far. But Phil&#8217;s jaw
was set and he turned to him a deaf ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s his own fault,&#8221; Phil confided to O&#8217;Neil
at his side. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t order his men in the
boats; they got in without orders, as any
decent men would do. What is it, O&#8217;Neil,
just pure cold feet?&#8221; he asked suddenly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;Partly that, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil answered, &#8220;but
Lieutenant Tillotson is not a coward; he&#8217;s just
overcautious and a bit of a braggart. He
didn&#8217;t like attacking in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>The four boats pulled with oars muffled in
toward the dim shore. Phil steered his boat
for a point behind the long fringe of flashes,
where the insurgent firing line was established,
creeping ever closer to the handful entrenched
behind walls that would soon be too hot to
hold them. He had abandoned his first plan
and now was landing all of his mixed command
to the left of the town. If he could
land without discovery, the first the enemy
would know of his presence would be the
horrifying, crackling report of the machine
gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, steer for that,&#8221; Phil breathed as a
mound-like hill took shape out of the darkness.</p>

<p>With eyes straining and faculties alert for
the first premonition of danger, Phil directed
his boat forward. The gunboat had been
swallowed up in the night astern. The shore
grew more distinct. The church now stood
out prominently, silhouetted against the background<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
of flames from the burning convent.
Even as he gazed the gun fire from the church
seemed to slacken and against the bright glow
he could see indistinctly natives swarming toward
the burning building. Their number
seemed myriad; surely those could not be all
riflemen. Then he turned cold as he suddenly
grasped the sinister meaning&mdash;they were bolo-men.
For each rifleman, at least four natives
armed with bolos are assigned. They are the
guardians of the precious rifle. To obtain an
insurgent gun, five men must be slain. These
men, armed with weapons in the use of which
every native is proficient, were advancing to
rush upon the trapped men when the heat of
the fire and the smoke had driven them from
the shelter of the church&#8217;s protecting walls.</p>

<p>So intent had Phil been that the boat, before
he realized it, had grounded on the sandy
beach and the men had jumped overboard into
the shallow water. Once on the beach, he
superintended the securing of the boats and
then led the way toward the point he had
selected for the first position to be occupied.
The enemy were only a few hundred yards
away, but so intent were they on the accomplishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
of their cruel purposes, that the
shadowy forms of the men from the sea, stealing
quietly through the short grass and
against a background of darkness, were not
discovered.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s quick eyes suddenly discovered some
one approaching from a direction away from
the enemy. He gripped his revolver firmly,
not knowing how many more men might be
behind the figure discovered. As the Americans
approached the newcomer, a native suddenly
raised his hand and called loudly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Amigo, hua carta.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A blow from O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s revolver butt was the
answer, while Phil grasped the letter which
had been held in the stricken man&#8217;s hand,
placing it carefully in his breast-pocket. Then
a warning cry rang out, followed by a rifle-shot,
the hot blast of which almost burned
Phil&#8217;s cheek, while a wiry form struck boldly
right and left with his keen blade in the very
midst of the startled Americans.</p>

<small>THE PRIVILEGES OF RANK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">There</span> was two of &#8217;em, captain,&#8221; the infantry
sergeant exclaimed, in that purely
official calm voice for which the army non-commissioned
officers are noted even under
the most trying and hazardous circumstances,
while he pushed away the body from beneath
his feet, after making sure the native was not
shamming. &#8220;They was messengers, telling
the gugus of the coming of the gunboat, I
reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The small band of soldiers and sailors
moved cautiously through the rank grass and
sparse cocoanut palms. The enemy before
the town had been too much occupied to discover
the disturbance in their rear.</p>

<p>Phil saw that the fire had grown apace and
now the conflagration threatened the entire
town, but the greatest danger was to the
church, for the dawn breeze was carrying the
hot, stifling smoke and flame high on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
church walls. It would be but a matter of
minutes before the church itself would be on
fire. The sun was slowly approaching the
horizon; Phil saw the broad white band of
light stretching across the eastern sky. Out
on the water to the right of the town the lofty
spars and smoke-stack of the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; were
indistinctly visible; Sydney was ready to begin
his allotted work when the day had broken
so that he could recognize friend from foe.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that fellow Tillotson hadn&#8217;t funked,&#8221;
the midshipman whispered fiercely, his teeth
set firmly, &#8220;and we could have had his men
to the right of the town, we could have flayed
&#8217;em alive. Now they&#8217;ll all escape past the
gunboat&mdash;unless we let the gunboat open the
ball and drive them all this way.&mdash;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221;
he cried determinedly.</p>

<p>They had now reached the grassy-topped
mound, the Colt gun placed in battery, and
the first string of cartridges fed into its steel
maw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sergeant,&#8221; Phil commanded tersely, &#8220;deploy
your men to the right and left, and take
shelter. Don&#8217;t fire without orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant saluted and gave a quick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
sharp command. The soldiers melted from
sight. This was a new experience for them.
Six months in the islands and the only real
fights they had seen were included in a few
shots at the disappearing brown men after they
had fired their volley from ambush, killing
and wounding several of their comrades. Now
here were over five hundred yelling natives
worked up to the wildest pitch of savage
triumph before their eyes, within range of
their trusty guns, and as yet no orders to fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop your grumbling,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil overheard
the sergeant tell one of his soldiers in language
more forceful than polite. &#8220;This is something
that your thick skulls can&#8217;t savvy. It&#8217;s
naval strategy. Wait till the ball opens and
every mother&#8217;s son of you can prove his claim
to a sharpshooter&#8217;s medal.&#8221;</p>

<p>When all was ready, Phil could only wait
patiently for the sun to give Sydney enough
light for his gunners to see to shoot, but meanwhile
he saw with ever-increasing impatience
that the enemy was gradually closing in about
the church and convent. If the dawn were
too long coming! If the terrible, irresistible
rush came before Sydney had opened fire, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
their attack would have failed, for the loss of
twenty American soldiers could not be repaid
by the death or capture of the whole insurgent
army. It seemed to the awaiting midshipman
that hours must have passed since his men
had entrenched themselves on this small hillock.
Surely the sun had stopped in its
movement around the earth! The flames in
the town became higher and the smoke arose
in greater volume while the crackling of burning
bamboo added its sinister sound to the discharges
of the rifles, ever drawing nearer the
besieged garrison. With heart beating rapidly
and youthful indecision stamped on his face,
he gazed anxiously at the &#8220;Mindinao.&#8221; He
breathed a sigh of partial relief as he saw she
was close inshore and was clearly visible.
Surely it was light enough to see, or if not yet
the enemy must soon discover the presence of the
unwelcome and much-feared visitor. When
they fled, their retreat would be toward where
he and his machine-gun and sixty-five American
rifles were awaiting them.</p>

<p>Moisture stood out on the youngster&#8217;s forehead
in great beads and his tongue lay like
cotton against the roof of his mouth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have stood it another second,&#8221;
he breathed, as a jet of flame shot out from the
gunboat&#8217;s bow and a sharp report followed by
thunderous reverberations awakened for the
first time an unknown terror in the hearts of
the savage attackers, and brought courage and
joy to the hopeless men inside the stifling
walls of the church.</p>

<p>The little gunboat belched flame from her
three-pounders and the eager and delighted
watchers on the mound of earth, clustered
about the Colt gun, gazed with admiration and
awe as the high explosive shells tore great
gaps in the earth, scattering the demoralized
natives in all directions. The avenue of
escape to the right was closed; the enemy
dared not approach nearer that death-dealing
war-ship, and with one accord, an uncontrolled,
terrified mob of human beings, without
method or leaders, they turned and retreated
directly toward the mound on which Phil
and his men were impatiently awaiting them.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil had taken his place at the Colt gun.
Seated in the bicycle saddle, he squinted
carefully down the massive rifle barrel, while
the seething mass of brown came ever closer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
When the insurgents had arrived at a distance
of two hundred yards, Phil gave the
order &#8220;Open fire,&#8221; in a voice scarcely recognizable
as his own, it trembled so with excitement.</p>

<p>Bang&mdash;bang&mdash;bang, faster than one could
count, resembling the explosions in the
cylinders of a high power touring car, only
infinitely louder and more sonorous, the Colt
gun hurled a solid leaden stream of bullets
into the charging mass.</p>

<p>As coolly as if he were merely steering a
boat, O&#8217;Neil played the leaden hose on the
startled enemy. They went down like chaff
before the reaper; while from behind urging
them onward, the cordite shells of the gunboat,
which had followed them, burst with terrific
havoc.</p>

<p>Throwing down their rifles&mdash;it did not
enter their heads to ask for the quarter which
the Americans would have been only too willing
to give&mdash;they turned inland directly toward
the burning town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cease firing,&#8221; Phil cried out in alarm, as
he saw suddenly appear, almost in the path of
the routed natives, the small band of men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
who had come so near death at their hands.
Rifles in hand, the relieved soldiers advanced
toward the now terrified insurgents and
poured a deadly fire into their already mortally
stricken ranks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; yelled Phil, leading the way
on a run, followed by his men. &#8220;We can bag
them all in that swamp.&#8221; But the lad did
not realize what fear can do for a native
Filipino. The Colt gun on the left where
O&#8217;Neil had advanced it on the run, and the
rifles of the threescore jubilant soldiers lent
wings to their enemy&#8217;s feet as those finding
themselves miraculously spared from instant
death plunged into that impenetrable mangrove
thicket. Volley after volley was fired
in the direction in which they had disappeared,
and the crash of the bullets could be
distinctly heard, but no white man could
have followed where they fled.</p>

<p>The sun was now above the horizon and the
light of day showed a gruesome sight to Phil&#8217;s
eyes. Many hundreds of natives lay dead or
in their death agonies on the sandy soil. The
doctor from the garrison and his assistants attempted
to help the sufferers, but after one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
hospital man had been maimed for life by a
wounded native to whom he was administering,
there could be little more to do. Graves
were at once dug in the little cemetery back
of the church and there they were placed one
on top of the other in long rows and then the
earth was thrown on top and covered with
rock to keep out the hungry mongrel dogs,
more savage even than their masters.</p>

<p>The fight had hardly terminated before a
small boat came quickly ashore from the gunboat.
Phil&#8217;s good spirits left him as he saw
Lieutenant Tillotson come swaggering up to
the group of soldiers and sailors. Sergeant
Sweeney, who had been in command of the
small garrison, had been excitedly giving Phil
the details of the attack, when the lieutenant&#8217;s
flushed, angry face brought him to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sergeant,&#8221; he cried in an insolent
harsh voice, &#8220;make your report to me; I am
in command here; this man has no standing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was so stunned at the words that he
didn&#8217;t understand or at least realize its meaning.</p>

<p>Then his righteous anger and loathing
welled into his throat.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap2"><i>&#8220;I AM IN COMMAND HERE!&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;How dare you talk of me that way before
your men?&#8221; he cried, his face pale as death,
and his strong fists clinched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, who are you, anyway?&#8221; Tillotson
exclaimed swaggeringly. &#8220;A midshipman!&mdash;ashore
you have no status, so from now on
please mind your own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil whispered, grasping
firmly but respectfully Phil&#8217;s arm. The sailor
felt the lad&#8217;s muscles standing out like whip-cords.
He foresaw that something was about
to happen. &#8220;Don&#8217;t spoil all our fun, sir. If
you hit him, which he richly deserves, you&#8217;ll
lose your ship, and where will Mr. Monroe and
Jack O&#8217;Neil be then?&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of his anger and mortification the
remark of his favorite brought a faint smile to
Phil&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right, Jack,&#8221; he replied, his
voice shaking with emotion, calling him unconsciously
by the name which he always
used in his thoughts, and allowed himself to
be led away.</p>

<p>The midshipman called his men together
and walked quietly toward the beach, while
Lieutenant Tillotson took entire charge of gathering
up the spoils.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;The lieutenant&#8217;s compliments, sir,&#8221; spoke
an orderly at Phil&#8217;s side as he was about to
step into his boat to go to the &#8220;Mindinao,&#8221;
where at least he did have some status. &#8220;And
he says, he orders you to send your men to
report to him to put things in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil turned on the messenger fiercely, and
then in time remembered the soldier was but
the innocent bearer of this insolent command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; the lad said with a tone
of humiliation in his voice, leading the way
back toward the burning town. &#8220;I suppose
I must pocket my pride. I am only a midshipman,
after all, and on shore here I am under
his orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Sydney had anchored the gunboat he
hailed a boat from the shore and soon stood
by Phil&#8217;s side. The fire was quite beyond
their control and inside of a few hours a great
part of the nipa town was in ashes. By almost
superhuman efforts most of the supplies
and ammunition of the garrison were rescued,
and piled in the little plaza in front of the
church, where tents were pitched and all
preparations made to receive the soldiers of
Captain Baker when they returned from their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
expedition to the northward. In interrupted
and fragmentary sentences Phil told Sydney
of the insults offered him by the army man.
Sydney&#8217;s eyes blazed in anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dastardly coward,&#8221; he exclaimed after
the story had been unfurled before him.
&#8220;While you were risking your life, he was
sitting on the quarter-deck apparently glad to
be in a place of safety, and now he comes and
wants to reap all the reward. I don&#8217;t see how
he has the face to appear before his men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not a regular, anyway,&#8221; Phil exclaimed
in a relieved voice. &#8220;O&#8217;Neil says the
sergeant told him he was some rich politician&#8217;s
son, a black sheep, appointed in a regular regiment.
That explains him somewhat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a yellow dog, that&#8217;s what he is,&#8221;
Sydney exploded, &#8220;and I&#8217;d like to tell him
so to his face, and I will, the first chance I
get.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t, Syd,&#8221; Phil said firmly;
&#8220;remember ashore here we&#8217;re under his orders.
Don&#8217;t give him an opportunity to make it
unpleasant. It&#8217;s bad enough as it stands.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where we can be of service,&#8221; he
suddenly exclaimed as his eye followed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
trailing end of a wire. &#8220;The telegraph instruments
were saved and are over there in
the grass; we&#8217;ll connect up and see if we can
get Palilo.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a half hour&#8217;s work with the help of the
single signal corps man, the instrument had
been remounted inside of a tent and the lads
watched eagerly as the operator endeavored to
call up headquarters. The instrument clicked
rhythmically for a fraction of a minute and
as it ceased the receiving relay clicked loudly
in return.</p>

<p>&#8220;The line&#8217;s O. K., sir,&#8221; the soldier said as
his hand rested on the sending key, and he
looked up for orders. &#8220;Shall I tell Palilo
that we&#8217;re all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was about to answer when he suddenly
remembered the stinging words of the lieutenant.
Pocketing his pride once more he shook
his head. &#8220;Report to the lieutenant that the
line is through,&#8221; he said as the two lads
turned away.</p>

<p>A few moments afterward, while they stood
outside the tent they heard the clicks of the
sending key. Each listened intently; not
with any idea of eavesdropping but because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
on board ship it had been a custom formed in
their Annapolis days to read all signals. In
this way they both had perfected themselves
in all forms of signaling and could read in all
codes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<i>To Adjutant-General, Palilo</i>:</p>

<p>&#8220;I attacked insurgents besieging garrison
at daylight. Placing the gunboat on
one flank, I sent guard with Colt gun on the
other. Attack was a perfect success. We have
captured nearly two hundred rifles. We
have no casualties. Baker still away.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Tillotson.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The midshipmen read the message, their
eyes opening wide with wonder as the busy
little instrument proceeded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all the nerve!&#8221; Phil exclaimed
as the signature was reached. &#8220;I attacked, I
placed the gunboat, I sent guard. But where
was he?&mdash;he doesn&#8217;t say, does he!&#8221;</p>

<p>At noontime the midshipmen found themselves
unwilling guests at Lieutenant Tillotson&#8217;s
table for the midday meal. Phil had
asked permission to withdraw his men on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
board ship but the lieutenant had curtly refused.</p>

<p>Napkins were a luxury not supplied, and
after finishing his dinner, consisting of wholesome
army rations, Phil drew out of his
pocket his handkerchief to use in place of the
missing square of linen. The letter taken
from the dead native fell at his feet. The excitement
and worry of the last few hours had
driven the knowledge of its presence from his
mind.</p>

<p>Tillotson&#8217;s keen eye was upon the letter and
he stretched out his hand for it in stony
silence. Phil gave it up instantly. The
lieutenant broke the seal and ran his eyes
quickly over its contents. His face showed
keen interest as he read; then he put the
letter carefully into his own pocket. The
midshipmen regarded him with interest, half
expecting to hear the purport of its contents;
but were disappointed, for in a few minutes he
arose and left them without a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rest of the garrison are returning,
captain,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil announced, joining the midshipmen
after his dinner with the soldiers.
&#8220;You can see their dust down the beach.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>The lads watched with ill-concealed delight,
much to Tillotson&#8217;s discomfiture, the arrival
of Captain Baker and his eighty dust-covered
soldiers. As they swung into the
Plaza, apparently for the first time, they realized
that something extraordinary had happened,
for they quickened their pace and
Captain Baker, unable to control his anxiety
further, shouted eagerly to ask what had happened.</p>

<p>Tillotson, assurance in his every motion,
walked out to meet him.</p>

<p>Phil could not refrain from comparing
these two figures&mdash;one that of Captain
Baker, alert, muscular, tanned by the sun, his
uniform dirty and stained by travel, with
grime on his soldierly countenance, while the
other, slender, his clothes neat and of a dandified
cut, seemed more in place in a drawing-room
than in the jungles of the Philippines.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw the gunboat when we struck the
beach below there,&#8221; Captain Baker exclaimed,
his anxiety relieved after Tillotson had
assured him all was safe, and he advanced
hand outstretched, a hearty smile of greeting
on his strong face. &#8220;Is this the new captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
of the &#8216;Mindinao&#8217;? I am glad to meet you
both,&#8221; he said as he shook the hands of the
midshipmen in turn. &#8220;I suppose we are
once more indebted to the navy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tillotson frowned. &#8220;I have fifty men with
me,&#8221; he exclaimed protestingly. &#8220;Of course
the gunboat was useful in bringing us here
and shelling the beach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become of all the town natives?&#8221;
Captain Baker asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They all left town yesterday morning,&#8221; the
sergeant replied. &#8220;That&#8217;s how we knew that
all was not going just right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cowardly beggars!&#8221; Captain Baker
exclaimed. &#8220;You&#8217;d have thought we were
their best friends. Well, I suppose they&#8217;ve
got to look out for themselves. Have you
buried all the bodies?&#8221; he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; Tillotson replied, &#8220;but your
sergeant has the names of all those he recognized;
apparently there were some of the
town people in the attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Baker nodded his head, a sorrowful
expression on his face. &#8220;Who can we trust
among these people?&#8221; he said in a low voice
as he scanned the list handed him. &#8220;Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
my own servant against us. Pedro might
have stuck a knife in me any night he
wished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A telegram, sir,&#8221; the captain&#8217;s orderly announced
handing him a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send gunboat &#8216;Palilo.&#8217; If desirable retain
Tillotson and men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Baker read the message aloud,
then his soldier eye gazed intently at the
lieutenant. The inspection from the expression
on the captain&#8217;s face had not been reassuring;
however, in a second he turned a
smiling face to Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Perry, I am sorry I am not to
have the pleasure longer; however, I am
deeply grateful to you and the navy for saving
my men. Tillotson, you can return; I&#8217;ll
keep your men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tillotson&#8217;s face, which had become
sorely troubled as the telegram had
been read, suddenly cleared. Phil felt that
he would have died if a soldier of Captain
Baker&#8217;s standing and reputation had even
hinted at his uselessness, as he had at this
hard-skinned, self-satisfied lieutenant.</p>

<p>After a night&#8217;s run the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
again tied up to the dock at Palilo. On the
trip down the lads had left their unpleasant
passenger severely alone, while he had spent
his evening writing, filling sheet after sheet
of paper with closely spaced lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Official report of a spectator,&#8221; Sydney
whispered loud enough purposely for Tillotson
to hear. The latter looked up and
scowled.</p>

<p>After breakfast the next morning Phil reported
at the general&#8217;s office. Major Marble
received him with a grave face.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the land&#8217;s sake, Perry! What have
you done to Tillotson? He denounces you in
scathing terms in his official report to the
general; accuses you of weakening his authority
before his men; humiliating him on your
own ship; deliberately shoving off from the
ship without him because he did not approve
of the entire plan which you devised without
his concurrence, and lastly reports you for
insubordination when under his orders ashore
and treating your superior officer with contempt.
In fact,&#8221; Major Marble ended, &#8220;he
has started at the top and gone to the bottom
of all the military offenses.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>Phil gasped in astonishment. Major Marble
stood gazing compassionately at his young
friend, apparently hoping to hear him clear
up the mystery. But Phil was silent. He
must have time to think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Phil had reached his ship he
scarcely remembered how he had behaved to
his anxious and sympathetic friend, Major
Marble. The boy&#8217;s mind was dazed. He
had not believed that Tillotson would dare
make charges against him, but now that they
had been made, how should he act? The
mere words of each charge were only too true
but Phil felt that he had had strong and
sufficient reasons for acting as he did. But
now he must refute these charges or else go
before a court-martial. But how could he
refute them? There was but one way and
that was to go to General Wilson and tell his
story, which would be corroborated by Sydney.
It would be tantamount to telling the general
that one of his officers was an arrant coward
and unfit to be trusted with hazardous expeditions.
And even then the charges would
still hold. They were true in substance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
every one of them. As commanding officer
of a gunboat Phil was within his rights when
he laid his plans as to where the attack of the
gunboat should be and the locality to land
his own men; but he could only advise the
army man from his nautical experience as to
where the best place would be to land the
soldiers in order that their co&ouml;peration might
be harmonious. Lieutenant Tillotson was
free to accept his suggestions or refuse them
as he saw fit. So long as they were both
afloat the army officer could give no orders to
him, nor could Phil give orders to his superior
in rank. To the anxious lad it was certainly
a perplexing situation. His conscience was
quite clear upon the soundness of the plan
he had proposed, and he felt that in carrying it
out they had struck a severe blow at the insurrection
and had saved the beleaguered garrison.
The lieutenant&#8217;s action might in feeble
minds be excused through the plea of caution,
but no strong man would hesitate to say that
it was a case where caution should not have
been considered.</p>

<p>Sydney was beside himself with indignation
when he learned of the spiteful charges of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
lieutenant and was for seeking him out and
bestowing personal vengeance, but Phil dissuaded
him from any such rash act.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have ordered his men out of
the boats,&#8221; Phil said bitterly, &#8220;when I saw
Tillotson was not coming. We might have
won without them, although they were a great
comfort, and if the Colt gun had gone back on
us they would have been a necessity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do?&#8221; Sydney asked, exasperated
at the apparent indecision of his
friend. &#8220;Tell the straight story to the general
and he&#8217;ll make it hot for that dandified gentleman
soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst of it is,&#8221; Phil replied gravely,
&#8220;Tillotson is the son of an influential man in
the Philippine government, and if he takes
our part the general will incur the father&#8217;s
displeasure, for a father will never believe
wrong of a son. A general has been suspended
for less, and that would ruin his army career.
I think our best plan is to try to compromise
with Tillotson, and if he won&#8217;t listen to reason
then ask the general to send us to another
part of the island.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Marble, as much as he disliked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
task, was in duty bound to hand this report to
the general through his judge-advocate general.
Captain Blynn believed he was a fair
man and was proud of his reputation of being
scrupulously honest, yet when he read this
arraignment of the young midshipman, a
smile, almost of pleasure, passed over his face.
Here was a case in which he took the greatest
delight. The captain instinctively disliked
Tillotson. He saw that he did not have the
making of a soldier, and this expedition had
been one of the few with which he had been
entrusted. On another occasion his command
had suffered severely from an ambush of
bolo-men, and there had been vague rumors
that Tillotson had not behaved as it was traditional
a &mdash;&mdash;th Infantry officer should, but
there had been nothing official, thanks doubtless
to his father&#8217;s influence. As Captain
Blynn read he recognized the work of a law
graduate. Each charge was described at
length in an enclosed letter. Undoubtedly
the circumstances were true.</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer youngster, that fellow Perry,&#8221; Captain
Blynn exclaimed almost in admiration as
he finished and folded the communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
preparatory to laying it before his chief.
&#8220;He&#8217;s got grit, but I fear bad judgment. I
could never see why he allowed that Martinez
to escape. Espinosa says it was deliberate.
Well, he must pay for his ill-judged acts. I
don&#8217;t want any one about here who&#8217;s going
to have qualms of conscience about killing a
Filipino who won&#8217;t surrender. He handled
that attack at Binalbagan splendidly, though,&#8221;
he thought. &#8220;But I am afraid we&#8217;ve got to
make an example of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Captain Blynn approached the general&#8217;s
office, he caught the sound of voices from
within, and soon saw that the midshipman
himself was talking earnestly with the general.
Captain Blynn was not deterred; with him
business was business and here was the officer
charged with a grave offense.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a letter here, sir,&#8221; he said in his
cold, official voice addressing his chief, &#8220;written
by Lieutenant Tillotson, making very
serious charges of misconduct against Midshipman
Perry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Perry has just told me that he
had heard of these charges,&#8221; the general replied
in an annoyed voice. &#8220;It seems to me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Perry, you have stirred up quite a hornet&#8217;s
nest in the few days you have been in Kapay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil blushed furiously, and his eyes flared
forth his indignation at such an unfair remark.
Especially as he could make no answer
to an officer of such rank.</p>

<p>The general adjusted his glasses and read
from beginning to end the report placed on
his desk by the captain; then he glanced up,
a puzzled look on his deeply lined face.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a very ugly business,&#8221; he said
sharply. &#8220;We have no time to investigate
such matters. We are busy putting down
this rebellion. Yet such conduct as charged
in this report, Mr. Perry, cannot go unheeded.
There&#8217;s but one thing to do,&#8221; he continued
after a moment&#8217;s thought. &#8220;Wire to the admiral
at Manila and request your detachment
for private reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be a tacit acknowledgment
that I am in the wrong,&#8221; Phil cried out, his
voice trembling with anger at the injustice in
the general&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read this letter,&#8221; the general said
brusquely, &#8220;and if you can clear yourself do
so before Captain Blynn and myself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>Phil took the letter and read page after page
of incriminating evidence against him. It
told of the disagreement as to the plan of
landing and the time of landing. Then of the
departure of the expedition from the gunboat,
when the accuser claimed that Phil had deliberately
shoved off without him, &#8220;doubtlessly
jealous of being outranked,&#8221; the report
read. Then of his insubordination ashore
after the attack when he, Tillotson, had taken
charge of the work of clearing up the battle-field.
Of the withdrawal of the sailors and
their refusal to help until an imperative order
had been sent the midshipman not to go to
the gunboat, but to return and give aid to the
soldiers.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart thumped as he read. The report
was untrue in so far as the imputations
on his reasons were concerned, but the incidents
were only too true, and except by bringing a
charge of cowardice and calling soldiers and
sailors to corroborate him, he could not deny
the report. Tillotson&#8217;s report stated further
that both midshipmen had during the return
trip acted toward him in a manner which lessened
the respect of the sailors for him. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
one of them had made remarks derogatory to
his character as a soldier.</p>

<p>Phil handed the report back, his eyes swimming.
His anger was rife within him and he
dared not speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a case for a Court of Inquiry,&#8221; Captain
Blynn said to the general, &#8220;but I cannot
see how an army court can decide on the case
of a naval officer. Mr. Perry apparently cannot
deny these charges, so if he is disinclined
to wire the admiral, I suggest that you send a
message asking to have him relieved.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general nodded his head in the affirmative
and Captain Blynn withdrew to prepare
the fatal telegram.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Mr. Perry,&#8221; the general said,
his face softening. &#8220;I have heard of your
fight, and it was a masterpiece. I believe you
have the stuff in you; but insubordination
cannot be condoned. You must learn to obey
and be respectful to officers higher in rank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t he tell the general just how
everything had happened?&#8221; he thought as he
listened to the kindly voice, &#8220;not to ask that
he might retain his ship but simply to clear
his name of this cloud.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>Captain Blynn appeared, telegram in hand,
which he laid before the general for his
signature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I send this,&#8221; the latter said turning
to Phil, &#8220;see Lieutenant Tillotson yourself,
and if he is willing to withdraw this report
I shall forget the incident.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil left the office, knowing that it was but
a respite. He had passed Tillotson on the
street when on the way to the general&#8217;s office
and had saluted and spoken, but his greeting
had been ignored.</p>

<p>It was dark when Phil left the headquarters
building and walked toward the docks. As
he passed slowly through a narrow street, the
forbidding windowless walls towering over him
with here and there a dark alleyway, where an
assassin might lurk, he instinctively felt for the
handle of his navy revolver lying in its holster
slung to his left hip. At the end of the street
near the river and but a few paces from the
gunboat he saw a calesa drawn up, its curtains
drawn closely, just beyond the glare of a street
lamp, and he was surprised to see a hand wave
to him from the gloom inside.</p>

<p>Stepping cautiously to the side of the awaiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
vehicle, he heard his name called in a
familiar woman&#8217;s voice. It was the unknown
girl of the &#8220;Negros.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;or Perry, may I speak to you?&#8221; she
inquired excitedly in Spanish.</p>

<p>Phil took her outstretched hand eagerly, forgetting
for the moment his own trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, se&ntilde;orita?&#8221; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to-night to the northeast corner of the
Plaza, at nine o&#8217;clock; bring some of your men
with you. Maria Rodriguez will show her
gratitude to the brave American officers.&#8221; He
would have detained her, to learn more, but
her sharp command to the alert driver had
come before he could recover from the startling
summons and the next moment the calesa
was racing madly up the street.</p>

<p>Full of his news, he boarded the gunboat
and confided to Sydney the girl&#8217;s
message.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maria Rodriguez,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.
&#8220;She&#8217;s the daughter of Juan Rodriguez, the
wealthiest Filipino in Kapay. I wonder
what&#8217;s up? Her father, you know, refuses to
join the insurgents, and yet will not aid the
Americans, and the general will not molest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
him. He lives on his estates just beyond the
city on the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil was summoned and told to make up
a party of five good men to accompany them
and then the midshipmen sat down to dinner;
but neither had an appetite for food.</p>

<p>Phil told Sydney of the outcome of his visit
to the general and the latter was cast down
with gloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t stay without you,&#8221; he asserted.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t something be done? Is there no way
to make this man Tillotson back down?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil shook his head. &#8220;I shan&#8217;t try. I&#8217;ll
just take my medicine. It&#8217;s bitter, but every
one who was there knows that he was in the
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nine o&#8217;clock saw the small party at the
northeast corner of the Plaza. The city seemed
deserted. There was no one on the streets.
Suddenly the clanking of a sword was heard
and the sailors slunk quietly out of sight
into the shadow of a near-by doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Lieutenant Tillotson,&#8221; Phil whispered,
&#8220;inspecting sentries; he&#8217;s officer of the guard
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the officer had passed, the party waited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
anxiously for several minutes and then a native
appeared walking slowly toward them
from a cross street. He stopped fifty yards
away and beckoned; then turned quickly and
walked away.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney leading, they followed the
vanishing figure ahead of them. He guided
them through street after street, leading
farther and farther away from the occupied
part of the city. Suddenly the native stopped,
beckoned with his hand, and entered a doorway
of a pretentious Filipino dwelling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your men must wait here, se&ntilde;or; it is the
se&ntilde;orita&#8217;s order,&#8221; the native told the lads.
&#8220;The officers are to come with me.&#8221; He
raised his finger to his lips to caution silence.
&#8220;If we are discovered it will mean death,
se&ntilde;or.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the game, sir?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked
eagerly, not having heard the whispered words
of the native.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re to stay here out of sight,&#8221; Phil explained
quietly. &#8220;If we need help I&#8217;ll fire
my revolver.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a parting caution the midshipmen
stealthily followed their guide up the street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
hugging the dark shadow of the houses, and
entered the wide archway of a large native
building. Inside was total darkness, and it
needed all their confidence in the girl who had
invited them to come to still their awakening
suspicions.</p>

<p>The guide gave a low whistle and the slight
sound caused their hearts to beat faster amid
the profound silence within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;ores, you have come,&#8221; a woman&#8217;s
musical voice dispelled their fears. &#8220;Please
step this way; I am sorry there can be no light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil quietly led the way in the direction of
the voice, and his eyes soon discerned the
figure of the girl, a darker object among the
surrounding gloom. He felt a warm, confiding
hand in his, and allowed himself to be led
deeper into the blackness of the building.</p>

<p>The midshipmen followed blindly; their
eyes, unaccustomed to the darkness, could see
nothing. They knew from an occasional contact
with a wall that they were in a narrow
passage and from the damp odor they knew it
must be some depth below the ground. Several
times their heavily shod feet slipped on
the muddy floor, and occasionally they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
hear the tinkly drip of water. The passageway
led gradually downward, the dampness
increasing.</p>

<p>Finally the girl stopped and the sound of
the heavy breathing of the four people filled
the narrow limits of their surroundings.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are underground passages, built
years ago during a threatened uprising of the
natives against the Spaniards,&#8221; Se&ntilde;orita Rodriguez
whispered. &#8220;This passage leads to the
secret chamber of the &#8216;Sociedad de Katipunan.&#8217;
To be present at a meeting the penalty for a
non-member is to take the oath or suffer death.
Only the direst necessity has brought me here
to-night. I have no right to ask you, se&ntilde;ores,&#8221;
she said pleadingly, &#8220;to take this great risk
for my sake, and if you so decide we can now
turn back. Lopez, my father&#8217;s trusted patron,
will go with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will go with you, se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; Phil answered
without a second&#8217;s hesitation. &#8220;What
are we to see?&#8221; he asked, unable to control his
curiosity at the mystery of it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, you shall discover for yourself,&#8221;
she said as she moved forward, her hand still
in Phil&#8217;s, while Sydney held his companion by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the coat sleeve and Lopez, as noiseless as an
Apache, brought up the rear. &#8220;The meeting
will not take place for some time, and meanwhile
we shall have time to talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silently they moved forward until presently,
from the sound of their footfalls, Phil knew
that the walls had receded and that they had
entered a large chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stairs, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; Maria whispered, and
the lads found themselves mounting earthen
steps. Again their feet struck wooden boards
and they knew that they had ascended from
the passage and were in a large room directly
over the one which they had just left.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the old Spanish inquisition room,&#8221;
the girl said in a low voice, &#8220;and a fitting
meeting-place for the Katipunan murderers.
But come, they may be here any moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil admired the daring of this frail girl.
She had led them into the very nest of these
traitorous outlaws, for it now dawned upon
him what was the true meaning of these
meetings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they enter the same way as we have
come?&#8221; he asked anxiously, casting an apprehensive
glance behind him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; Maria answered, a smile on her face
as she felt the lad&#8217;s hand tremble imperceptibly
on her own. &#8220;We are not in the
room; it is beyond us, as you shall see soon.
We are in a covered gallery which is secret
and known to but few even of the society.
The passage through which we came has not
been used for years, and until last night was
closed with earth. Lopez has spent all day
with some of his most trusty men clearing it
in order that we might pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil cautiously peered about him, but his
eyes could not penetrate the darkness. He
knew that his feet were on boards, and that
his hand rested upon a wall which was
rough and dry. Then suddenly as if by a
flash of lightning a vivid picture of his surroundings
was shown him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are coming,&#8221; Maria whispered in a
startled voice. &#8220;Lie down and for your life
do not speak.&#8221; The next second all was again
blackness. The lads and their companions
had noiselessly thrown themselves down on
the floor and were holding their breath in an
agony of suspense. The cool handle of Phil&#8217;s
revolver, which he had unconsciously drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
from its holster, brought back his confidence.
At least they would not die without some
injury to their enemy.</p>

<p>Again came the flash of light; it flickered
and seemed on the point of extinction, and
then continued dimly. Phil recognized that
this time the match had not gone out in the
room over which their gallery looked, and that
a candle was dimly burning. Then another
and another candle was lighted and little by
little the great room was exposed to their view.</p>

<p>Figures of men could be seen clustered
about a table in the far end of the hall, some
seated in chairs, but most of them on the
ground in native fashion, while beyond the
table was a niche in which an image glittered.
The midshipmen soon discovered that it was
an exaggerated emblem of the Katipunan
society which they had seen on insurgent
flags; the sun within a flaming triangle,
all of pure silver.</p>

<p>A noise of feet and guarded voices came to
their ears as the room slowly filled with men.
As the light from the many candles shone
upon their faces the anxious watchers saw
that each man was masked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>After an interminable interval of time all
was hushed and a man arose from a seat near
the symbol of the society and beckoned one
of the others to approach.</p>

<p>Phil felt the girl beside him tremble
violently, and give a sharp gasp of pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Garcia,&#8221; she breathed, &#8220;my father&#8217;s
trusted friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our unknown brother,&#8221; the leader said in
Spanish, which Phil was to learn was the accepted
language of the society, &#8220;has been
summoned to join our society; his name is
recorded secretly in the recording book; his
number is one thousand and ten.&#8221; The
leader then drew from his scabbard a sharp
glistening bolo and circled it with the adroitness
of a juggler about the head of the newly
enrolled member. Gradually one after another
of the masked natives arose, their keen-bladed
bolos held aloft, while in single file
they moved slowly with a rhythmical dancing
step toward the silent &#8220;one thousand and ten.&#8221;
As they advanced a weird chant broke from
twoscore throats. It was not loud, but the
volume filled the high vaulted chamber and
lent an uncanny air to the mysterious initiation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
It seemed to Phil as he watched, his
eyes fairly bulging from their sockets, that
the unfortunate man would surely be severed
into a thousand pieces by these fierce, savage
fanatics, but he stood silent, his arms folded
across his breast, while his eyes gleamed in
exultant excitement.</p>

<p>Slowly the members danced by their new
comrade and returned to their seats.</p>

<p>Then the new member, by sign from the
leader, advanced and prostrated himself before
the emblem.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sign of giving his life to the cause,&#8221;
Maria whispered. Then she stiffened and a
stifled sob broke from between her clenched
lips as the voice of the speaker filled the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodriguez has refused the summons. He
is no longer our friend. He has gone over to
the despised Americans. Through him our
men were attacked and killed at Banate, and
also at Binalbagan. He holds his servants
from joining our cause only through fear.
Once he is removed they will all join us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all untrue!&#8221; Maria&#8217;s voice, clear, low,
and distinct, sounded through the room, and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
once the assemblage was on its feet, gazing distrustfully
at each other. Phil&#8217;s hand had
grasped the girl&#8217;s arm with a grip of steel,
fearing that in her indignation and anger she
would expose herself to the view of these twoscore
traitors.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>IN THE SHADOW OF A SUSPICION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil&#8217;s</span> heart beat tumultuously as he laid a
restraining hand on Maria&#8217;s arm to prevent
her from rising up from the floor of the gallery.
The instant the girl&#8217;s indignant, vibrating
voice was heard an uncanny silence fell upon
the masked men. Each looked fearfully at the
other. Every man mistrusted his neighbor.
The girl&#8217;s heavy breathing sounded ominously
loud in the lad&#8217;s ears, and he was dumb with
apprehension that she would sacrifice them all
by a second outburst of passionate denial.
They dared not move. There was naught to do
but wait. If the society determined upon a
search then their one chance was to make a
dash for the passageway, and hold the angry
men at bay with their revolvers. O&#8217;Neil and
his five men were near the entrance, and Phil
felt sure that their cause was not altogether
desperate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>After an interval that seemed hours the
leader&#8217;s voice broke the heavy silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who dared deny that Rodriguez has betrayed
his people?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s strong fingers pressed firmly the girl&#8217;s
arm and his eyes begged obedience.</p>

<p>The masked men sat as if turned to stone.
No sound broke the stillness.</p>

<p>A loud knock on the door behind the
speaker brought the assemblage to their feet
in sudden fear. Phil saw that many had
drawn their bolos, while others stood ready to
extinguish the long rows of candles.</p>

<p>A challenge was called and answered, and
the next second the door was opened from
within and a native entered. Phil beheld in
admiration the air of grace and fearlessness
while he advanced boldly toward the startled
leader.</p>

<p>A smothered exclamation from Maria caused
the lad&#8217;s eyes to travel quickly to her face.
She was staring, a horrible dread stamped on
her face, while she murmured in a trembling
voice: &#8220;Mi Padre!&#8221;</p>

<p>So this was Juan Rodriguez, who had been
denounced but a moment since by the terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Katipunan society, come to answer in person
to the charge!</p>

<p>Another native followed him closely; neither
were masked, and Phil recognized, in startled
wonder, Colonel Martinez.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellow countrymen,&#8221; Rodriguez exclaimed
in a loud, commanding voice, &#8220;I have obeyed
your summons, but I shall not join the society.
I shall never take sides in this war until I feel
in my heart that to do so will better my
countrymen. You who are deceiving the
Americans, pretending that you are loyal and
yet aiding your countrymen to kill them,
doubtless believe that you are doing your
country a service, but I know that in the end
you will bring terrible suffering on our people.
Take the field and fight openly and honorably,
and you will be treated by your enemy
as a brave antagonist, but fight with a knife,
stabbing your enemy in the back, under the
guise of friendship, and the end is surely the
gallows tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur of harsh voices filled the room
as Rodriguez stopped speaking.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned to this striking figure,
as the light from many candles revealed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
finely moulded face, flashing eyes and firmly
chiseled lips and chin.</p>

<p>As Phil watched, his eyes opened wider in
dread. The leader had edged, during the long
speech, nearer and yet nearer to Rodriguez.
Martinez was standing silently on the other
side. Phil&#8217;s anxious gaze caught the flash of
brightly polished steel in the hands of this
masked native, now but a few feet from his
intended victim. Maria saw, but her voice was
frozen within her. Phil gauged the distance
to the would-be murderer, for his intention was
only too evident. It was not over fifty paces.
Surely it was possible; he had often practiced
at that distance. His revolver was now pointing
at the Katipunan leader, whose hand
could be seen to be stealthily rising. Phil
steadied one shaking hand with the other and
pulled the trigger. The loud report of the
discharge was deafening, and below in an instant
all was the wildest confusion. Swiftly
all lights were extinguished and the room was
plunged into inky darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; Phil urged excitedly, &#8220;we must
get O&#8217;Neil and save Juan Rodriguez.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blindly they felt for the stairs and quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
descended; then hand in hand they ran along
the dark, slippery tunnel. Reaching the
street Phil gave a low whistle, which soon
brought O&#8217;Neil and his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you fire a shot?&#8221; the sailor asked
anxiously. &#8220;We thought we heard one, but
it seemed a long ways off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Phil replied, &#8220;but follow us; there&#8217;s
work to be done; the se&ntilde;orita&#8217;s father is in
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Led by the native, Lopez, each sailor with
his revolver drawn sped down the narrow
street. At the corner they saw a small band
of men approaching. Phil halted his party
and waited ready to attack if they turned out
to be enemies. The next moment Maria had
thrown herself into her father&#8217;s arms, and was
sobbing hysterically, while his native followers
withdrew to some distance and stood on guard
in respectful silence.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney wrung the hand of their
former captor Martinez.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would Captain Blynn say now?&#8221;
Phil exclaimed laughingly as O&#8217;Neil too
squeezed the colonel&#8217;s hand until the latter
winced. &#8220;He&#8217;d shoot us for traitors sure.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>Sydney smiled. &#8220;It would be rather difficult
to explain the situation,&#8221; he replied, the
drollness of the meeting suddenly striking him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saved my life, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; Rodriguez exclaimed
suddenly, as Maria led him to the
Americans. &#8220;My daughter has told me all. I
do not know how she could have gone where
she did, or how she found out that I had been
summoned, but bringing you there has shown
that often one&#8217;s greatest enemy lives in one&#8217;s
house and eats his bread. I came this evening
bringing with me my own men, for I know
these blackguards too well to trust myself
alone. As all were masked I recognized no
one, but I have suspicions as to many and especially
he who you probably have killed,
for he fell limply at my feet just before the
lights were extinguished.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden pang of remorse came into Phil&#8217;s
thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Martinez came with me as my
friend and protector,&#8221; said Rodriguez, &#8220;and
although he is an enemy within your lines I ask
that he be allowed to withdraw in safety. You
see,&#8221; he added with a smile, &#8220;we had no idea
of meeting those who would recognize him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>Phil as the leader of the Americans gave a
ready assent. He well knew that a strict interpretation
of his duty required that he arrest
Colonel Martinez on the spot and take him
prisoner before the general, but intuitively he
realized that to do so would hurt the American
cause. He felt that Rodriguez had
reached a crisis in his avowed intention of
neutrality. By arresting Martinez after this
appeal Phil might lose the government a valuable
friend, now wavering between his loyalty
to his own people and the more earnest duty
of fighting against them to protect them from
the domination of this treacherous band of
murderers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, se&ntilde;ores,&#8221; Maria cried eagerly,
as her father signified his intention to depart.
&#8220;I can never thank you enough for what you
have done to-night. If your bullet,&#8221; she
added earnestly, &#8220;has silenced forever that
terrible leader of the Katipunan society, my
father will be in no further danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you pass through the lines?&#8221; Sydney
asked, &#8220;or shall we vouch for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is not too much trouble,&#8221; Rodriguez
replied gratefully. &#8220;My carriage is just there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
and we are then near the last patrol. The
general has allowed me free conduct always,
but this disturbance may have aroused suspicion,
so I shall be grateful for your services.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mixed party of sailors and natives
walked briskly through the silent streets.
The carriage drawn by two fast horses was
reached, and Maria, her father, and Martinez
entered, while Lopez mounted the box and
drove slowly forward followed by the Americans
on foot.</p>

<p>A loud American challenge suddenly
brought the horses on their haunches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt! Who comes there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Officer,&#8221; answered Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Advance one, and be recognized,&#8221; the
sentry called.</p>

<p>Phil walked slowly forward until he was
within ten paces of the alert soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil stopped in his tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re a naval officer,&#8221; the soldier
said in a puzzled voice. &#8220;You&#8217;re too young
to be a brigadier-general, although you&#8217;ve got
a star there on your shoulder-strap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil smiled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>&#8220;Yes, sentry, I am Captain Perry of the
gunboat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, sir, you can pass me, any time,&#8221;
the soldier exclaimed gladly. &#8220;That was certainly
great work you done in Binalbagan.
All the boys is talking about you two officers
and Jack O&#8217;Neil. I&#8217;d like to meet him; he
must be a corker.&#8221; The sentry had grounded
his rifle and now stood at ease talking sociably,
very much at home with the young midshipman.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is here,&#8221; Phil replied. &#8220;If I may
pass my party, I&#8217;ll call him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, captain, anything you say goes
with me,&#8221; the sentry returned enthusiastically.</p>

<p>The carriage, followed by the band of a
dozen natives, drove down the street away
from the city. Phil caught a wave of a hand
from the window as he turned and started for
the gunboat and his bunk, for it was near
midnight.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil had stopped to shake hands with
the admiring sentry and he soon overtook
them.</p>

<p>In silence they marched to the ship. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
much had happened, crowded into such a
short space of time, that the lads wanted a
chance to think.</p>

<p>The next morning while Phil and Sydney
were at breakfast on the small quarter-deck
of the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; Captain Blynn crossed the
gangway from the dock. He walked to
where the lads had risen from their chairs to
greet him. Refusing their offer of breakfast
with an impatient movement of his hand he
sat down in the proffered seat held for him
by the attentive Chinese steward. Both lads
saw in his grave face that something unpleasant
had happened to account for this early
morning visit. The army man did not keep
them long in suspense, and had his say with
his usual directness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Tillotson, the officer of the
guard yesterday, is missing. His bed shows
that he did not sleep in it at all last night. I
have investigated the case as far as I have
been able, and I find that no one passed
through the sentries except a closed carriage
and a squad of Filipinos. This sentry says
that you and Mr. Monroe vouched for them.
Tillotson was last seen an hour before this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
time by a sentry at the bridge whom he
visited. As soon as I heard of the carriage
episode I cautioned the sentry to say nothing.
I wanted to see you and clear up that part before
I investigated further.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil sat speechless in his seat while the
judge-advocate general talked on earnestly.
Tillotson had disappeared! How could he
have been forcibly carried past the numerous
guards stationed at every outlet of the garrisoned
city? He must surely still be within
the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suspect foul play?&#8221; Phil questioned.
&#8220;Would the enemy have the daring
to make way with him inside the town?
Why should he alone be molested? And, besides,
he carried his revolver, and could not
be struck down without being able to fire a
warning shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One sentry,&#8221; the captain replied quickly,
&#8220;reported having heard a shot from the part
of town near the sea, but he said it was very
indistinct, and after all he was not sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney exchanged glances and
the captain looked up sharply, a faint suspicion
entering his thoughts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;What I&#8217;d like to know,&#8221; he added coldly,
&#8220;is who was in that closed carriage; the
sentry says there were four people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil flushed as he read the insinuation in
the captain&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Juan Rodriguez, his daughter and a
Filipino overseer by the name of Lopez,&#8221; he
answered promptly, but he lowered his eyes
before the direct, searching gaze of the judge-advocate
general. The presence of Colonel
Martinez need not be told. It would but
complicate the case and not aid in the search
for Tillotson; but the army officer knew
human nature too accurately, and Phil was
too poor a hand at telling less than the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was besides a Filipino with the
driver?&#8221; he questioned pointedly.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was this Lopez within the carriage with
Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez and his daughter?&#8221; the
captain asked curtly, and Phil felt as if he were
on the witness stand having the whole truth
dragged from him. He might just as well
make a clean breast of it. Before those piercing
black eyes, he found that he was not
good at dissembling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;Lopez was driving,&#8221; Phil said blushing
furiously in mortification at being so easily
tripped in his testimony. &#8220;The other occupant
of the carriage was Colonel Martinez!&#8221;</p>

<p>If a bombshell had exploded at Captain
Blynn&#8217;s feet he could not have appeared more
astounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you passed this insurgent officer out
of our lines?&#8221; he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>Phil nodded, his throat dry and his mind
stunned with a sudden fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is certainly a queer proceeding!&#8221;
the army man exclaimed. &#8220;I cannot fathom
it. Do you realize what you have done?
Can you not see that Lieutenant Tillotson&#8217;s
disappearance will be laid at your door?
But surely,&#8221; he added, &#8220;there is some explanation
which you can make? You could
hardly be so foolish as to plot against the
life or even the liberty of a brother officer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gave a sudden exclamation of surprised
indignation, and with flashing eyes he turned
angrily on his accuser.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see your meaning at first,&#8221; he
said in a low, intense voice but one that carried
distinctly over the ship. &#8220;How dare you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
insinuate this to my face and on board my
ship?&mdash;Captain Blynn, there&#8217;s the gangway!&#8221;
he cried sternly, his face now deathly pale
but his jaw set firmly.</p>

<p>Captain Blynn rose hurriedly from his
chair, his dark face swollen with passion; his
black eyes flashed, while his strong hands
clutched his chair nervously. He was about
to speak, but Phil cut him short, pointing his
finger toward the exit to the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope, Captain Blynn,&#8221; he said quietly
though his lips were trembling, &#8220;that you
will see the uselessness of further talk and
will go ashore as I have bid you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You confounded little whipper-snapper!&#8221;
the captain exploded wrathfully. The stern
judge-advocate was unused to such treatment;
he had always bullied those under him and
in a measure by the very force of his will,
many of those senior to him in rank. But
angry as he was he realized that the midshipman
was quite within his rights. He
was on board his own ship, and there he was
supreme.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Blynn, I hope it will not be
necessary for me to have you escorted across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the gangway,&#8221; Phil reiterated, his voice showing
perfect control of temper. The lad
glanced forward meaningly to where many of
the crew had collected, intently listening to
the heated colloquy between their young captain
and this big, blustering army officer.</p>

<p>Then a voice from the dock made both the
combatants turn suddenly and gaze in surprise
at the general, who, unobserved, had
stopped abreast them and had been an amused
spectator of the discomfiture of his judge-advocate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tear up that telegram as soon as I get
to the office,&#8221; he exclaimed chuckling gleefully;
&#8220;and, Blynn, you&#8217;d better come ashore
here before Captain Perry pitches you over the
gangway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn had but one great fault and
that was his inability to consider that anything
mattered outside of his beloved work.
Ruthlessly he would trample over those in
the way of success. Once he was on the trail
of a wrong-doer, he would follow it fearlessly
until the culprit was behind bars.</p>

<p>Doubtless if Captain Blynn had stopped for
just a moment and considered the young officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
before him, he would not have cut him
to the quick by an insinuation so cruel. To
do the brusque captain justice, he had regretted
his words immediately he had spoken and
seen the look of injured innocence and anger
in Phil&#8217;s face, but the masterful way in which
Phil had turned the tables on him was too
much for the army man&#8217;s temper and hence
the invective. In his heart he did not really
believe that Phil was guilty of plotting against
Tillotson. Without the interruption from the
dock he might even have apologized to the
spirited young navy man, but the general&#8217;s
words injected a salutary humor into this dramatic
situation and made him see how untenable
and cruel was the attitude he had assumed.
His face softened and an apology of a smile
struggled for place on his sun-tanned countenance.
&#8220;You&#8217;re dead game, youngster,&#8221; he
exclaimed impetuously. &#8220;I believe you&#8217;re on
the level, only you&#8217;re a bit too reticent; anyway,
here&#8217;s my hand, and from now on we&#8217;ll
work together instead of at cross purposes.&#8221;
He took the surprised midshipman&#8217;s hand and
shook it heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up to the office at ten o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
added as he walked toward the gangway, the
smile having disappeared and the alert business
expression taking its place on his face.</p>

<p>The midshipmen watched him cross the
gangway and join the general, who had been
taking his usual morning exercise before going
to his office, and as the two walked along
apparently deep in conversation an orderly
stopped them, handing a telegram to the general.
The lads saw him open it and read and
then pass it to Captain Blynn. Both turned
as if by a mutual impulse and glanced toward
the gunboat, then changing their minds apparently,
they again turned and walked briskly
toward the headquarters building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something in the telegram concerns us in
some way,&#8221; exclaimed the analytical Sydney.
&#8220;I wonder what it said?&#8221; But Phil&#8217;s mind
was too much occupied in thinking of the
chameleon character of his new friend to give
more than a passing thought to the contents
of the telegram.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>A TRAITOR UNMASKED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;How</span> dared he accuse me of knowing about
Tillotson&#8217;s disappearance?&#8221; Phil exclaimed as
he sought unsuccessfully a solution to the
mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he really suspected us,&#8221;
Sydney replied deprecatingly, &#8220;but it must
have struck him as odd to say the least that
you should pass an insurgent officer through
the guards. You didn&#8217;t tell him why you did
it or even give him any of the circumstances.
I think it was natural that he should act as
he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize,&#8221; Phil said half laughing,
&#8220;how queer it must have seemed to him.
Well, I&#8217;m going up and make a clean breast of
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any suspicion as to the identity
of the man I shot?&#8221; Phil suddenly asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought at once of Espinosa,&#8221; Sydney
answered, &#8220;but I&#8217;m not sure; he talked in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
voice that was not familiar, but that may have
been feigned. Think of it,&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;those masked men are all in the employ of
our government. They have taken the oath
of allegiance and yet they are plotting to massacre
our soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems queer,&#8221; Phil exclaimed in a puzzled
voice, &#8220;that the meeting and Tillotson&#8217;s
disappearance should happen the same evening.
Do you suppose it was only a coincidence?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get Captain Blynn to unravel that,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;He&#8217;s not half as clever as some
believe, not to have discovered in six months
what we have in less than two days. But remember,
we promised Se&ntilde;orita Maria to say
nothing of her share in the work.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later the lads had laid their startling
discoveries before the judge-advocate.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many of these men did you count?&#8221;
he asked excitedly, after he had listened with
rising indignation to the account of the Katipunan
meeting and the accusation against
Rodriguez.</p>

<p>&#8220;About forty, I should say,&#8221; Phil answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; the captain exclaimed
aloud, &#8220;why Espinosa has not told me of
the existence of this society. Of course I knew
it was active elsewhere, but I had no idea they
would dare plot against us within our lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you never suspected Espinosa?&#8221;
Phil asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, once,&#8221; the captain answered, after a
moment&#8217;s hesitation, &#8220;but I found I was mistaken.
He would not have led us against this
fellow Martinez if he had been a traitor. I
have the note here which I took from Espinosa
that gives the information. It is in Visayan
but I have translated it.&#8221; He handed the
scrap of paper to Phil, who read it and passed
it back.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Colonel Martinez and two hundred men
encamp to-night at Barotoc Hill near Banate
en route to join Diocno.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Phil pondered over the words of the message.
Then he remembered the terrible personal
attack of Espinosa against Martinez.
Was this a clue to his betrayal? Were Martinez
and Espinosa personal enemies?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; the captain continued assuredly.
&#8220;Espinosa has aided us in every way. It was
through him that we sent Captain Gordon to
the north to prevent more of these deserters
from Aguinaldo&#8217;s army landing. He has kept
us well posted on the movements of our
enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But still,&#8221; Phil insisted, &#8220;there have been
no big fights and we&#8217;ve lost a number of men
cut up through surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s due in a great measure to the country
and the inexperience of our volunteer
officers,&#8221; the captain explained readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you so sure of the honesty of Rodriguez?&#8221;
he asked suddenly. &#8220;I have heard it
insinuated that he aspires to the leadership if
Diocno were removed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was about to cry out his assured belief
that Rodriguez was sincere, but with the
words on his lips he hesitated. He had seen
Rodriguez but once, and to be convinced of
his honesty after such a short acquaintance
would sound ridiculous. He saw that Maria&#8217;s
part would have to be told if Captain Blynn
was to be convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have every reason to believe in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
sincerity,&#8221; Phil said instead. &#8220;I can understand
Spanish and I heard the leader
denounce him as a traitor to the natives.
Then I heard Rodriguez&#8217;s eloquent appeal to
the men against their two-faced dealings.
He surely had the courage of his convictions,
for every hand there was against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the general had him down here the
other day,&#8221; the captain said, &#8220;and he was impressed
the same way. He&#8217;s a power among
the lower classes, although he has many
enemies among the educated ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn had been holding a telegram
in his hand while the above conversation was
taking place and now he passed it over in
silence for Phil to read.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Colonel Martinez is not the name of insurgent
officer that left Manila about the time
of sailing of steamer &#8216;Negros.&#8217; Our secret
service men are sure that he is the noted outlaw
&#8216;Remundo.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;So you see,&#8221; the captain said not unkindly,
&#8220;you have twice allowed this desperado to
escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now,&#8221; the captain continued, &#8220;what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
we&#8217;ve got to do is to break up this secret
society and find poor Tillotson if he is still
alive. I can hardly believe that they have
been able to carry him away unless it was
by water. However, Espinosa should know
of this. I will send for him to come here at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain rang his bell and sent the
orderly who answered for the Filipino.</p>

<p>The midshipmen sat silently waiting while
the judge-advocate returned to his interrupted
office work.</p>

<p>The orderly soon returned, reporting that
Se&ntilde;or Espinosa was not at his house, and that
his servant reported that he had not been
home since the evening before.</p>

<p>The midshipmen exchanged knowing
glances. Was Espinosa then the leader whom
Phil had shot?</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; Captain Blynn exclaimed, starting
up from his chair. He led the lads down
to his carriage at the door and motioned them
to enter. Then giving an address to the
driver they went whirling through the narrow
streets.</p>

<p>After a ten minutes&#8217; drive the carriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
stopped in front of a large Filipino house.
Without knocking the army man pushed open
the door intruding his great bulk into the
room.</p>

<p>A half dozen natives arose from the floor,
sudden fear in their faces as they saw the
officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;or Cardero,&#8221; the captain said in a quiet
voice, &#8220;where has Se&ntilde;or Espinosa gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; the native replied sullenly.</p>

<p>The captain glared fiercely at the small
brown man before him; then he reached out a
strong hand and caught the native fiercely by
the neck, shaking him as a dog would a rat.
The little man turned a sickly color and his
teeth chattered, but the bullying American
held him closely while his eyes flashed angrily
as he questioned him. &#8220;Tell me, where is
Se&ntilde;or Espinosa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is hurt, se&ntilde;or commandante,&#8221; the native
cried out finally in a terrified voice after he had
regained his breath. &#8220;It was an accident. I
do not now know where he is, but he is not in
the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen were overjoyed at this
news. So Espinosa was the Katipunan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
leader and spy. Phil glanced at the surprised
judge-advocate, a light of triumph in
his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Perry,&#8221; the captain ordered
hurriedly, &#8220;you and Mr. Monroe stay here
and guard these rats; I am going to have
every native of prominence in the town
arrested at once. Thanks to you, we have at
last found the leak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Throwing the cringing native from him,
he strode out of the door, and the lads heard
the rumble of his carriage wheels as he drove
rapidly away.</p>

<p>After the captain&#8217;s menacing presence had
been removed the half dozen captive Filipinos
showed signs of restlessness, and once
or twice Phil surprised a covert glance toward
a dark corner of the large living-room.
Both lads felt the responsibility of their position.
They knew that they were outside of
the line of sentries, almost beyond the sound
of firearms. It seemed to Phil that the
captain was over-reckless in coming with
only themselves into the haunts of a probable
enemy. Both lads were armed, their revolvers
were held ready in hand and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
prisoners knew full well that Americans were
dangerous shots.</p>

<p>The inside of the room was but dimly
lighted by a single oil wick, and the darkness
became blacker toward that part of the
house where no windows had been cut. Phil
had heard the captain give instructions to his
orderly as he left headquarters to have a
guard follow the carriage. But would the
guard be sent here to aid them, or would
Captain Blynn send them elsewhere to make
arrests?</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get out of this trap,&#8221; Phil whispered
anxiously to Sydney at his side, his idea
being to order the men at the point of his revolver
to pass out to the street.</p>

<p>Suiting the action implied in his words,
Phil opened the door leading from the living-room.
He saw by the aid of the additional
light from outside that the five men had
cautiously and stealthily moved backward
toward the wall nearest them, and were apparently
supporting their weights upon it.
Suddenly he felt a jar and read in the eyes
of the Filipino nearest him revenge battling
with fear. Then the floor shook, and grasping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
Sydney by the shoulder Phil threw himself
bodily through the open door as the floor
of the building crashed down twenty feet
into the cellar below. The natives, he could
see, were hung on the wall like so many old
coats, while through the bamboo floor on
which he and Sydney had just stood numberless
bamboo spears bared their sharp, venomous
points. The lad shuddered as he realized
the murderous trick which had failed. If
they had fallen with the floor, heavily
weighted as it was with stones at the side,
and resting on supports, which had been
dislodged by a rope in the hands of one of
the villains now hanging on the wall of the
room, they would at this moment be lying
pierced through and perhaps dying before the
eyes of their cruel enemy.</p>

<p>He raised his revolver and covered the
nearest cringing native, a terrible anger in
his eyes. In another second he would have
pulled the trigger, but Sydney&#8217;s hand closed
firmly over his wrist, forcing his revolver upward
and the ball sped harmlessly over the
terrified native&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are more valuable alive,&#8221; Sydney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
exclaimed to Phil&#8217;s angry cry of protest.
&#8220;Come, let&#8217;s get outside before more of this
hinged floor is loosened. We can better prevent
their escape in that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil followed his companion down the
bamboo stairs and into the street, where a
crowd of curious natives had gathered on hearing
the startling shot. The lads moved their
weapons menacingly, not knowing or trusting
the temper of the crowd which backed away
cringingly from the Americans. A glance
down the street brought a glad cry from the
midshipmen as they saw a squad of soldiers
advancing from the direction of headquarters.
A loud voice in the Visayan tongue from the
building they had just left was answered by
many excited voices in the gathered crowd,
and then several women advanced slowly,
holding up their hands in sign of peace, their
bodies close together as if for mutual protection.
The lads scarcely noticed the approach
of the women, so occupied were they
in watching the building in which were imprisoned
five of the traitors who had been
biting the hand of the master that fed them.
A swift glance over his shoulder showed Phil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
that the advancing women were scarce ten
paces away from Sydney, who was guarding
one corner of the house, while he was some
thirty feet away, guarding the other three
sides. The soldiers were not over a block
away and hastening toward him; he could
hear the rattle of their gun slings, and the
thud of their heavy shoes on the hard road-bed.
Then again as he cast an uneasy glance
at this line of women his heart froze within
him while his voice failed, for he had caught
a fleeting glimpse of a savage face peering
over their shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out for yourself,&#8221; Phil cried, directing
his revolver at the line of women and firing
blindly. In that second his disgust and
wrath were so great at the dastardly strategy
under the guise of friendship that he would
not have felt a qualm of conscience if one of
these unnatural women had fallen before his
bullet.</p>

<p>The women halted, sudden fear on their
faces, while from between them dashed a half
dozen savage natives armed with bolos. As
they charged on the surprised midshipmen
they cried out lustily in their guttural language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
the war-cry of the bolo-man who has received
the charm of the Anting-Anting which
to his superstitious mind makes him invulnerable
against the Americans&#8217; bullets. They
came boldly on while Sydney jumped backward
quickly to Phil&#8217;s side and the two lads
emptied the contents of their revolvers into
the mass of naked brown men flourishing
their keen blades above their heads in an endeavor
to close with their hated foe. The
women had run screaming with terror back
to the safety of the crowd, taking refuge
within the densely packed houses.</p>

<p>With their revolvers empty and but three
of their half dozen assailants writhing in the
road, the plucky midshipmen faced the onrush
of the fanatics. Converting their revolvers
into clubs, they awaited what seemed
to them certain death. Their one hope for
safety lay in running away from the charging
bolo-men and toward the soldiers now scarce
two hundred yards away, but turn their backs
on an enemy they could not.</p>

<p>Within ten feet of the midshipmen the
fanatics suddenly stopped and a fear crept
into their superstitious faces. The next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
second, to the lads&#8217; astonishment, their sharp
swords dropped from nerveless fingers, and
the three natives prostrated themselves in the
dust of the road.</p>

<p>The lads gazed in startled wonder, scarcely
believing their eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>THE MIDSHIPMEN RECONNOITRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> midshipmen were so utterly astonished
at the actions of their fanatical enemies that
they could only gasp out their surprise in one
heartfelt word of relief. Then a familiar
voice at their elbow awoke them from their
stupefied inactivity. It was in Visayan and
they turned to gaze into the impassive face
of Rodriguez.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have ordered them to escape,&#8221; he added
in Spanish, casting a quick glance toward the
squad of soldiers. &#8220;Poor fellows, it would be
a pity to kill them, for they are but acting
under orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads were too grateful to their rescuer
for saving their lives to make useless inquiries
as to why his influence could be exerted over
the acts of their enemy. Phil&#8217;s first thought
was for the men whom the captain had left
them to guard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>&#8220;Surround this house,&#8221; he commanded,
and the sergeant in charge gave a short command
and led the way himself to the rear of
the large native building.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too late, se&ntilde;or commandante,&#8221; Rodriguez
said shaking his head; &#8220;they have all
escaped through the rear door and are by now
safely away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen ran quickly up the steps
and gazed disappointedly into the gloom beyond.
The floor still lay at the bottom of the
cellar, the bamboo spears sticking half-way
through, but the natives had gone. The back
door stood open and to the ground was a jump
of twenty feet. They had safely escaped while
the lads were engaged defending themselves
against the attack of the bolo-men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am on my way to see General Wilson,&#8221;
Rodriguez announced after a search had failed
to disclose any signs of the fugitives, &#8220;and
offer my services.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you will fight with us
against the insurgents?&#8221; Phil asked in glad
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, from now on I shall aid the Americans
to restore order in the island of Kapay,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
Rodriguez replied, pleased at the cordial reception
given him by the two midshipmen.</p>

<p>Together the party made their way back to
headquarters in search of Captain Blynn.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was providential that I happened
along,&#8221; Rodriguez said after they had passed
through the sentries; &#8220;those bolo-men knew
me and obeyed my sign. I see,&#8221; he added smilingly,
&#8220;that you are already arresting the traitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were not very successful with Se&ntilde;or
Cardero and his friends yonder,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
ruefully, &#8220;but I suppose we should be
thankful to have gotten off so easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cardero is one of the craftiest of our outlaws,&#8221;
Rodriguez returned. &#8220;It is a marvel to
me how he could have remained unmasked so
long. Of course,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I have known
of this intrigue for some months, but until
they deliberately plotted against my life I
could not betray them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you discovered who is the Katipunan
leader who tried to murder you last night?&#8221;
Sydney asked excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Rodriguez replied. &#8220;You have
doubtless guessed that he was Espinosa. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
know it now for sure. He has gone to Matiginao,
where there is a strong fort, and is in
command of all the insurgent forces there.
The bullet only crippled him last night, and I
hear he is rapidly recovering. General Diocno
was murdered last night in his bed and no
doubt I should have shared the same fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were by this time at the headquarters
building, and were glad to find that Captain
Blynn had returned. The midshipmen informed
the army man of their luckless adventure
and stood in silence expecting to hear his
harsh rebuke for allowing such important
prisoners to escape, but he only grasped their
hands and congratulated them upon their rare
good fortune.</p>

<p>&#8220;By George,&#8221; he exclaimed excitedly,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve been contentedly living over an active
volcano. It&#8217;s a marvel we haven&#8217;t all
been massacred long ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every native of any consequence in the
town has departed,&#8221; he added sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodriguez with you, and wishes to aid
us?&#8221; he cried gladly, as Phil told of the intention
of the wealthy native. &#8220;Well, that
certainly is cheering news.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Rodriguez came into the office and stood
with dignified bearing before the big judge-advocate.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are tired of being neutral?&#8221; the
army officer said pointedly in Spanish. &#8220;Do
you wish to occupy the position just vacated
by our mutual friend Espinosa?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rodriguez drew himself up proudly while the
midshipmen gasped at this harsh arraignment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not blame you, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; the native answered,
no evidence of anger on his placid
face. &#8220;I know that you can have but little
reason to trust the honesty of the men of my
race. But I do not desire a position. I am
now ready to take the field with my men,
heretofore neutral. I have three hundred
rifles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ready then to take the oath of
allegiance?&#8221; Captain Blynn asked in official
tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, se&ntilde;or, and keep it,&#8221; Rodriguez returned,
his eyes unflinching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any news that will lead to our
knowing the whereabouts of Lieutenant Tillotson?&#8221;
Blynn asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I have,&#8221; the native answered eagerly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
&#8220;I was about to ask you&mdash;my spies report a
captive with Espinosa.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Americans gave sighs of relief. At
least Tillotson was alive.</p>

<p>General Wilson received Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez
with marked courtesy and appointed him on
the spot a colonel in command of his own
men whom he offered to enlist as native
troops, rationing and feeding them from army
funds, but Rodriguez declined the latter,
agreeing to defray all expenses.</p>

<p>The midshipmen insisted that their new
ally should go down to the dock and inspect
the gunboat, so after explaining to General
Wilson that they would like to be absent for
a few days on reconnaissance work, the three
strolled leisurely down the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Colonel Martinez?&#8221; Phil asked
after they had arrived on board and the
Chinese servant had brought refreshments.</p>

<p>Rodriguez shrugged his shoulders and
pointed toward the interior of the island.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he serve under Espinosa as leader?&#8221;
Sydney asked incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; Rodriguez answered evasively.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>The lads saw that their friend had reasons
for being non-committal and tactfully ceased
their interrogation, yet inwardly they were
consumed with curiosity. Espinosa had attempted
to kill Colonel Martinez on the
morning of Blynn&#8217;s attack, and now would
they serve amicably side by side against a
common enemy?</p>

<p>The hour for lunch arrived, and as
Rodriguez was not leaving for several hours
to return to his home up the river he gladly
accepted the midshipmen&#8217;s pressing invitation
to eat with them.</p>

<p>Phil had made up his mind to explore the
river, though this idea was unformed in his
mind when he left headquarters.</p>

<p>During the meal the midshipmen questioned
their guest about Espinosa&#8217;s impregnable
stronghold and of its approach by
water.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a trail from my ranch to the
foot of the mountain,&#8221; Rodriguez replied
thoughtfully, &#8220;but it will be filled with traps,
and will be dangerous if Espinosa hears an attack
is to be attempted. The river flows
through a narrow gorge at Matiginao, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
from the cliffs huge boulders can be dropped
into the river many hundred feet below.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gunboat!&#8221; he exclaimed in amazement,
after Phil had questioned in regard to
the depth of water. &#8220;If it were possible!&#8221;
Rodriguez glanced admiringly at the heavy
cannon mounted near him. &#8220;Yes, with this
gunboat in the river the tops of the cliffs
could be swept, and soldiers could scale the
difficult trail unopposed, and once through
the narrows the trail leading from the stronghold
could be commanded by the cannon to
cut off the retreat of the insurgents. It is
wonderful! But the bridge, Se&ntilde;or Perry,&#8221;
he ended, his voice betraying his sudden disappointment;
&#8220;it is strongly built and a gunboat
cannot pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I find there&#8217;s water enough to float
the &#8216;Mindinao,&#8217;&#8221; Phil replied assuredly,
&#8220;the bridge will not stand in the way long.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does your daughter know the country?&#8221;
Phil asked earnestly.</p>

<p>Rodriguez gazed a full minute at his questioner
before he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every foot of it,&#8221; he added; &#8220;she was
born near the stronghold. But what is your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
intention, se&ntilde;or? This is no work for a
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil would willingly have bitten off his
tongue for having led him into such an embarrassing
situation. He could not tell Rodriguez
that he wanted Maria because she
alone would he trust as a guide on the perilous
mission which he had made up his mind
to make.</p>

<p>Major Marble fortunately arrived at this
moment and saved the lad from becoming
more deeply involved. He gave them the
latest news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tillotson&#8217;s father is keeping the wires
hot,&#8221; he told them. &#8220;We are ordered to spare
nothing to recapture him, but of course we
shall do that anyway. The general has wired
back the good news the se&ntilde;or has brought, that
Tillotson is believed to be a prisoner and alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the party dispersed, Phil confided to
his hearers his plan to explore the river and
his intention to start that very night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will visit me on my ranch?&#8221;
Rodriguez exclaimed gladly. &#8220;Everything I
have is at your service,&#8221; he added with the
grandiloquent air of a Spanish gentleman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Phil nodded gratefully, realizing that unlike
the Spaniard, whose form of address the
native copied, Rodriguez made no empty offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; the lad continued, a spark of
enthusiasm in his voice, &#8220;that a gunboat of
the tonnage of this vessel is capable of reaching
the insurgent stronghold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can accomplish that,&#8221; Major Marble
exclaimed excitedly, &#8220;you and your &#8216;Mindinao&#8217;
will make an enviable name for yourselves,
for once that stronghold is taken we
shall have many surrenders throughout the
island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not force the insurgents to concentrate
on Matiginao,&#8221; Phil asked earnestly,
&#8220;and attack them there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The general has already sent out orders,&#8221;
Major Marble told them, smiling at the lad&#8217;s
eagerness, &#8220;to attack the insurgents wherever
they can be located and for all the troops to
concentrate on Palilo, leaving small garrisons
in the towns to guard the peaceful natives.
He is working up a big plan to attack this
stronghold with a large force, and will undoubtedly
take the field in person. He is determined
to rescue Tillotson, and will give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Espinosa no rest until he is captured or
killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen listened in delight to this
plan, which fitted in so well with their own
ideas.</p>

<p>The major soon departed, promising short
work in destroying the bridge if the lads discovered
the river to be navigable above the
house of Rodriguez.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil was ordered to have a boat&#8217;s crew of
four men ready to leave the gunboat at one
o&#8217;clock at night. The distance to Rodriguez&#8217;s
ranch was somewhat over fifteen miles and the
lads did not desire to be seen, so they would
pass at night and be safely within friendly
land by sunrise. Rodriguez left them soon
after to return by land and promised a hearty
welcome on their arrival up the river.</p>

<p>Promptly at one o&#8217;clock the expedition
started. O&#8217;Neil had provided the usual gear
for surveyors; a compass, a lead line, and also
a rifle for each man and a revolver for himself.</p>

<p>Silently they shoved off and rowed with
muffled oars up the river, and under the
bridge, built substantially in the days of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Spaniards. &#8220;A few charges of dynamite
would settle it,&#8221; Phil thought.</p>

<p>Already O&#8217;Neil had uncoiled his lead line
and was sounding in the channel of the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a cinch, sir,&#8221; the boatswain&#8217;s mate
exclaimed after several soundings had given
him no less than four fathoms of water.
&#8220;Seven feet is all we need and we can carry
that for miles until the mountains commence
to go up steep; then there&#8217;ll be rocks to look
out for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mile after mile was pulled in silence except
for the light dip of the oars and the dull, almost
soundless splash of the lead as it was
heaved a short distance forward of the boat.</p>

<p>The midshipmen gazed with apprehension
at the forbidding banks of the river. The
rank tropical foliage would conceal an army.
Riflemen might lie concealed and fire without
the slightest fear of discovery.</p>

<p>Gradually the river narrowed, but the depth
of water did not grow less.</p>

<p>It was just before dawn when the boat arrived
at the bend behind which, by the description
given them, would be the landing
pier of the Rodriguez ranch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>In a half hour the boat was being cared for
by one of the many willing attendants and the
sailors were escorted to the palatial residence
of Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez.</p>

<p>It was the se&ntilde;orita who came first to meet
her old friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we are fighting together,&#8221; she exclaimed
gladly, &#8220;and I would like to go out
as a man and help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil thought that nothing so far had deterred
her. She had seen as much fighting as
most men and had withstood it bravely, and
he said so to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might be valuable, se&ntilde;orita, to put
courage in men&#8217;s hearts,&#8221; Sydney added smiling,
&#8220;but you would not be very formidable
as a soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maria bit her lips vexedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can shoot as well as a man,&#8221; she cried half
angrily, &#8220;and I can ride a horse and paddle a
canoe. What more is needed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something which is not in your makeup,&#8221;
Phil answered admiringly. &#8220;You are
not vindictive and are not cruel. But you can
do us a favor, if you will. We want to explore
the country between here and Matiginao.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>Maria clapped her hands with joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know every foot of the country,&#8221; she
cried eagerly. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have better
guides than my little brother and I. But,&#8221;
she added, her voice becoming lower and a
fear in her eyes, &#8220;my father is now an enemy
to the ladrones and insurgents, and it is unsafe
to wander away on the lonely trails.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney exchanged glances as
much as to say, &#8220;There is your woman&#8217;s argument.
One moment she wants to fight and
the next she speaks of danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez welcomed the midshipmen,
and together all sat down to a large
table where a delicious breakfast was served.</p>

<p>Phil saw his men were provided for, as he
intended leaving them behind, and after
breakfast Maria led the party out where
five finely bred horses were held by native
grooms.</p>

<p>Maria and Juan, who sat his pony as gracefully
as if he were a part of the animal, led
the way across the open fields surrounding
the ranch houses. Then they plunged into a
path cleaving the giant trees of the tropical
jungle. Limbs of trees brushed their faces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
and great care was necessary to prevent themselves
from being unhorsed.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s idea was for the boat to wait until
dark, and then row up the river as far as
possible and return by morning, in order
that the general could be informed of the
feasibility of the plan and the work of destroying
the bridge started. His party, meanwhile,
were bent on following this trail
toward Matiginao, to reach the ranch before
the boat and wait for it. He realized that
they were running a great risk, but he believed
the necessity for the information was
worth the risk run. The trail led mostly
within sight of the snake-like river. They
passed many dwellings, most of them deserted
of all save hungry mongrels and starving
pigs.</p>

<p>&#8220;This seems to be a fine trail,&#8221; Sydney said
surprisedly, as they walked their horses two
abreast.</p>

<p>&#8220;It leads but five miles further,&#8221; Maria
replied, &#8220;and from where it ends, all other
trails are those made by animals, and followed
seldom by men.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a brisk trot Maria started ahead. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
jungle bent away from the road, leaving a
high arched canopy over the heads of the
travelers, through which the tropical sun
shone with sullen impotence.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a small bungalow up here,&#8221; the
girl announced in pleasurable anticipation.
&#8220;We shall have our lunch there. Before the
big house was built we lived there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long has it been since you were
there?&#8221; Sydney asked in sudden anxiety, the
fear entering his mind that it might now
have other occupants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for years, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; the girl replied in
a low voice. &#8220;It is very lonesome, besides
there are many pulijanes<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in the mountains.&#8221;</p>

<p>The house soon appeared through the thick
grove of cocoanut palms with its unkept lawn
sloping gently to the river. The grass in
front of the house was overhead high, and
everything had grown wild and in luxuriant
profusion. The house itself was in ruins.</p>

<p>While Maria and little Juan had taken
charge of the horses and tethered them amid
a good repast of alfalfa, the two lads strolled
down to the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;Hello, here are some canoes!&#8221; Phil exclaimed;
&#8220;and they&#8217;ve been tied here recently,&#8221;
he added anxiously, as he saw clearly
the fresh footprints and the grass trodden
down near the landing.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_204.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;HELLO, HERE ARE SOME<br />
CANOES!&#8221;</i></p>

<p>The lads&#8217; intention had been to investigate
the depth of the water in the river, but their
startling discovery made them forget all else
save the visible evidence that a small body of
men had recently landed at this very spot
and had taken the almost obliterated trail to
the abandoned house. Maria and her brother
might even now be prisoners among their
enemy. The two midshipmen gazed at each
other through eyes wide with apprehension.
What was to be done?</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t desert the girl,&#8221; Sydney declared,
gazing at the trodden grass. &#8220;Otherwise we
might reach the horses and escape before they
discover us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, &#8220;there are not
many of them, and maybe,&#8221; he added reassuringly,
&#8220;they are not all armed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two lads walked noiselessly toward the
house along the dim trail.</p>

<p>The building was now in plain sight. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
wide porch with its profusion of clinging
vines was deserted. The long flight of bamboo
steps was half in ruins. To the right not
a hundred yards distant their horses were
standing, their noses deep in the rich grass.</p>

<p>At the foot of the steps the midshipmen
halted. There was a mysterious silence in
the air about them and they imagined that
from the deserted building unfriendly eyes
were peering down upon them.</p>

<p>Phil gave a sigh of relief as he saw Maria,
leading little Juan, come slowly through the
tall grass toward them from the neighborhood
of the horses. He made up his mind
quickly. Nothing further could be gained
here, and the evidence that others had been
on this spot very recently was too strong not
to take the warning. He caught Sydney&#8217;s
arm and wheeled him away from the house.
The lads had not taken a half dozen steps before
a shrill cry from Maria riveted them in
their tracks. Over their shoulders they saw
that now the porch was filled with natives
who were pointing their rifles at them menacingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, we might as well face them,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
Phil whispered, his teeth tightly clenched
and with his hand on his pistol.</p>

<p>Turning, Phil led the way back to the
steps, and there he halted, glancing inquiringly
at the unfriendly guns covering him.</p>

<p>A native, apparently an officer, dressed in
a dull gray cotton uniform, walked slowly toward
him down the rickety steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you insult me and my friends
on my own door-step?&#8221; Maria&#8217;s voice was
high pitched in anger. &#8220;These gentlemen
are my guests. By what right are you
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Filipino officer had stopped half-way
on the steps in surprise, his revolver held in
front of him. Unconsciously he dropped its
muzzle toward the ground and regarded the
girl in unfeigned admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; he said apologetically,
using the Spanish of the higher classes of
Filipinos. &#8220;You, then, are Se&ntilde;orita Rodriguez,
and I ask your forgiveness for my rudeness.
I thought these se&ntilde;ores,&#8221; indicating
the two midshipmen with a nod of his head,
&#8220;were Americans and my enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s ears were startled by a loud peal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
laughter, and he gazed in almost horror at
the girl, believing that she had become
hysterical. But a glance at her smiling face
showed that her nerves were well in hand.
An angry flush suffused his face as it crossed
his mind that this was a trap of her own
laying. But he blamed himself instantly for
even entertaining such a thought. What
would she say? She must acknowledge that
he and Sydney were Americans, naval officers,
though they were not in uniform, having on
khaki riding suits. Phil&#8217;s hand slowly drew
out his revolver from its holster, while his
eyes were turned now on the averted face of
the native officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;From what part of the island have you
come?&#8221; Maria asked quickly, the smile of
superiority still on her face and Phil saw that
to the native the smile was disconcerting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am just from Matiginao,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I came for fresh meat. To forage on your
father&#8217;s land.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smile died on Maria&#8217;s face, but luckily
the native had withdrawn his eyes and was
regarding closely the young men before him.</p>

<p>Maria felt that the Filipino officer must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
know of her father&#8217;s enmity to his new
leader, Espinosa. Then as the native&#8217;s eyes
again traveled to her face the smile reappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see all white men are to you Americans.
These se&ntilde;ores are my guests. I vouch for
them,&#8221; she told him in a confiding voice.
&#8220;It was a natural mistake for you to make,
Se&ntilde;or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she stopped questioningly, and he
supplied the name. &#8220;Salas, colonel in the
Filipino army, se&ntilde;orita, at your service,&#8221; he
said bowing gallantly.</p>

<p>Maria had not guessed at the officer&#8217;s
identity although she knew most of the important
leaders, having known them as a girl
at her father&#8217;s house before the war had begun.
Now the mention of his name almost
made her heart stop beating. This frail creature,
with the face and figure of a boy, was
feared by all who had fallen under his control.
He had won the unenviable reputation of
being the most cruel of the insurgent leaders,
first in Luzon under Aguinaldo and then on
the island of Kapay. He was scarcely older
than Phil, and yet he held the rank of colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; she smiled, &#8220;is one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
well known throughout Kapay. In appearance
you are not the ogre that you are
painted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Salas&#8217; white, even teeth gleamed between
his thin lips. He felt himself the
master of the situation. Here was the proud
daughter of Rodriguez complimenting him.
His small soul was nourished by the thought
that he was feared by all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you do not
consider me an ogre, will you and your English
friends accept the offer of a share in my
frugal meal? It is now ready inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen had watched with beating
hearts this plucky girl&#8217;s brave fence with the
subtle native and as he pronounced the word
English he glanced at the silent lads. Phil
thought he saw a gleam of joy in his cruel
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;They do not speak Spanish?&#8221; he asked,
shrugging his shoulder expressively as much
as to answer the question himself in the negative.
It was better so; one could play the
game better than two and the lads now knew
that Maria was an adept in diplomacy, and
could be depended upon to make a better and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
intelligent fight for their lives. That their
lives were in danger was but too evident to the
lads. The native soldiers still covered them
with their rifles, and Colonel Salas had moved
to Maria&#8217;s side as they had talked, leaving the
line of fire quite clear. A word from him and
a score of bullets would be tearing through
their bodies. Did the officer believe that they
were English? Had he already seen through
the deception, and made up his mind to
maneuver so as to kill them at the least risk
to himself and men? Phil gauged the distance
between himself and the insolent face of
this young colonel and resolved that the word
of command to his men to fire should be a
dear one for the smiling colonel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>UNWELCOME COMPANIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lads indeed found themselves in an
awkward predicament. Just the faintest
thread really bound them to life, for they saw
in the cruel expression in the eyes of the
Filipino officer that nothing would delight
him so much as to have these white men shot.
Phil very much feared that in spite of his
cordial words this boyish native had before
now guessed the truth. However there was
nothing to do but remain silent and inactive.
Phil had a great desire to speak to Sydney in
English, but he feared this dapper little
Filipino might have learned enough of that
language to understand what he might say.</p>

<p>With his cold eye on the midshipmen the
native officer gave a gruff command to his
men behind him on the porch. Phil&#8217;s hand
moved a hair&#8217;s breadth, and the revolver muzzle
on his hip pointed squarely at the body of
Colonel Salas, while his finger pressed ever so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
slightly the trigger. For the fraction of a
second their eyes met. Then the lad saw
with relief that the soldiers had lowered their
guns and were filing through the door into
the house. With a deft motion he allowed
his revolver to slip noiselessly back into its
holster.</p>

<p>Colonel Salas had already turned and was
leading the way up the steps, Maria and her
brother following, and the midshipmen bringing
up the rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he suspects us?&#8221; Sydney
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must,&#8221; Phil answered hurriedly. &#8220;Be
careful, Syd,&#8221; he added anxiously. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got to fight our way out. There seems no
other way. There are twenty of them against
us two.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the top of the steps Salas turned and
looked questioningly at the midshipmen.
Phil dared not meet his eye for fear that the
little native would see the anxiety which he
strove to hide.</p>

<p>On the floor of the big room a cloth had
been spread and a repast set out.</p>

<p>With a graceful wave of his thin hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
Colonel Salas made a sign for all to be seated
and took, himself, the place beside Maria.
Phil sat on the other side of Maria, while
Sydney and little Juan were placed opposite.</p>

<p>Their brisk ride had given them all an appetite,
but the terrible predicament in which
they now found themselves had quite taken
away their relish for food. The lads did their
best to appear undisturbed, but any one with
half an eye could have seen the restlessness
behind their forced tranquillity.</p>

<p>It is not the Filipino custom to talk while
eating, and it was not until his dish was
emptied that Colonel Salas broke the awkward
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your English friends are very fond of adventure,&#8221;
he said suddenly. &#8220;Our camp is
only a league up the river, and would be well
worth a visit. I did not intend to return so
soon, but I shall be glad to take you there.
You can return to-day or remain until to-morrow
morning. It is the strongest fortified
camp in the islands, and has never been successfully
attacked. You can see where three
Spanish regiments were annihilated by having
rocks rolled down upon them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>Phil&#8217;s heart beat faster. Here was the very
opportunity he had wished for. If they could
only see this camp with their own eyes; photograph
the surroundings in their minds; test
the depth of the water and the width of the
channel, would it not be worth the fearful risk
they would run? Then the thought of Espinosa
drove the possibility of such a hazardous
undertaking from his mind. They would
then surely be recognized even if they had not
been already, and he shuddered to think of
the penalty. What was his astonishment
when Maria agreed gladly to the plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be fun, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she
cried in English, appealing to the utterly bewildered
lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bueno! We can ride to &#8216;El Salto de
Diablo&#8217; (the devil&#8217;s leap), and there I shall
have &#8216;bankas&#8217; ready to take us to the foot of
the trail,&#8221; Salas returned delightedly as he
left them to instruct his men sleeping on the
shady porch at the back of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you realize what you are doing?&#8221; Phil
muttered excitedly. &#8220;At any moment he
may discover who we really are. Suppose
word should come to him from the city? We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
must not accept his invitation,&#8221; he ended
hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear,&#8221; Maria whispered, &#8220;that he already
suspects who you are, and for that reason I
have accepted. If I refused we are already in
his hands, and what can we do against his
twenty rifles?</p>

<p>&#8220;We must act it out, and, if opportunity
offers, escape. Above all, don&#8217;t show by sign
or word that you suspect him and don&#8217;t show
how much Spanish you know,&#8221; she ended
fearfully, as she saw Salas approaching with
several of his men.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart beat like a trip-hammer at this
disquieting belief of Maria. She was certainly
keen. By what system of argument had she
arrived at such a conclusion? To Phil Salas
had appeared to believe the story told by the
girl. Sydney and Juan had listened attentively
to her words.</p>

<p>In a short time the party were in motion.
A horse had been captured from the herd of
those that had run wild during the absence of
their owner, and Salas sat it well. Phil
thought he had never seen such a graceful
horseman. The wild horse reared and plunged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
in its efforts to unseat the rider, but he could
not be disturbed. The native followers formed
about them, and the party moved slowly along
the uneven road.</p>

<p>After a half hour&#8217;s ride, Salas ordered a
halt at the base of a bluff several hundred feet
high. The midshipmen gazed with inward
emotion at the towering cliffs ahead of them,
through which ran like a torrent the muddy
Tubig River.</p>

<p>&#8220;From here we must go by banka,&#8221; the outlaw
explained. &#8220;My men will go on foot, for
they are accustomed to the rough trail; but for
the se&ntilde;orita it would be impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the natives approached his chief
timidly, and spoke a few short sentences in a
frightened voice.</p>

<p>On hearing the man&#8217;s words, Salas&#8217; face
darkened in anger and he struck him brutally
with his heavy whip. The startled native recoiled
in terror from his incensed master.</p>

<p>&#8220;He tells me that there is but one banka
ready,&#8221; he explained apologetically; &#8220;the other
bankas are at the foot of the trail two miles up
the river. The ones we used this morning I
left at the ranch. I am sorry, but as only five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
can go in this boat some of the party must
walk. Who shall it be?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are just five of us,&#8221; Maria suggested
enthusiastically. &#8220;My brother and I are at
home with a paddle and surely the se&ntilde;or
colonel has often propelled his own boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Salas glanced keenly at the girl&#8217;s face. He
saw nothing there save youthful eagerness for
adventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you wish,&#8221; he replied carelessly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a tedious journey: two miles against the swift
current. My men are used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Maria&#8217;s mind was set upon their going
together. Phil pondered upon what her plan
might be. The river was now narrow and the
colonel&#8217;s men would always be within hail.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do with our horses?&#8221; Phil
questioned. &#8220;Are we to return here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall leave some men here with them,&#8221;
the Filipino leader assured him. &#8220;We shall
either return by the way we came or else over
the trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vamos,&#8221; he concluded, waving his hand
toward the large canoe which two of the
natives were holding close up to the steep
river bank.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>Maria took her place in the bow while the
others distributed themselves evenly upon the
frail low seats, grasping their paddles ready to
balance the boat when it was cast adrift in the
swift current.</p>

<p>Salas stood undecided upon the bank; his
men had gone over the trail leading through
the almost impenetrable jungle between them
and the high palisade upon which was the
outlaw&#8217;s stronghold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the horses here,&#8221; he said finally to
his two men, &#8220;and go back to the palm grove
and bring up one of the canoes we left there
this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil from his seat in the stern of the banka
caught a significant look flung to him out of
the eyes of the girl who was seated in the
bow, her head bent gracefully backward regarding
the Filipino leader. In the rear of
Maria was little Juan, his small hands
grasping a paddle, much too large for his
strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give the se&ntilde;or your paddle, Juan,&#8221; the
girl ordered, then turning to Salas she added
persuasively, &#8220;Sit behind Juan, se&ntilde;or. I&#8217;m
afraid he might fall overboard and I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
know what my father would do if anything
should happen to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The outlaw smiled and took the empty
seat, taking from the boy&#8217;s unwilling hands
the large paddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bueno,&#8221; he exclaimed, while the two men
released the boat, pushing it gently away out
into the stream.</p>

<p>Under the strong strokes of four paddles,
for the midshipmen were both expert, having
owned canoes at the Naval Academy, the
native boat swept swiftly through the water.
To avoid the strength of the current the canoe
was steered close in to the steep bank under
the protecting shade of the overhanging trees.
Great crocodiles basking on the muddy banks
were passed, the animals slinking away as
the boat approached, their long tails lashing
furiously in their haste. Monkeys filled the
trees, whistling and jabbering fearlessly as the
boat passed under them.</p>

<p>While Phil exerted himself manfully at his
paddle, his thoughts busily sought a plan to
escape the enforced hospitality of Salas. A
great fear filled his mind as he dwelt upon the
horrors of imprisonment among these lawless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
men. To Sydney and him it would eventually
mean death, and to Maria and her little
brother a long and dangerous imprisonment
and harsh treatment. But why had not Salas
made them prisoners at once if he suspected
their real identity? Phil did not guess that
the outlaw had read defiance and action in the
midshipmen&#8217;s eyes, and alert as the outlaw&#8217;s
faculties had become to scent danger even
though carefully concealed, he had detected
the stealthy motion of Phil&#8217;s hand when he
had been confronted by his men. Salas was
not a coward, but he had realized instantly
that if he ordered his men to open fire, unless
the first shots killed the Americans, he himself
would fall the victim of their vengeance.
So he was biding the time when he would
have them safe without danger to himself.</p>

<p>The boat had now covered nearly half the
distance. Phil wondered what he could do.
The slight figure of the outlaw, seated upon
the low thwart just in front of him, was so
temptingly close and apparently so unconscious
of any threatening danger. The native&#8217;s
revolver lay in its holster just within reach
of the lad&#8217;s hand, the flap securely buttoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
upon its polished handle. Phil realized that
when Salas expected treachery his first act
would be to capsize the canoe. Being a strong
swimmer the native doubtless believed he
could reach the bank first and have at his
mercy those still struggling in the water. To
attempt to unbutton the flap of the holster
and take the revolver without the owner&#8217;s
knowledge was impossible. Phil needed both
of his hands to wield the heavy paddle and
if he stopped paddling Salas would at once
suspect treachery. His heart rose in his throat
and his pulses throbbed painfully as a bold
plan flashed suddenly into his thoughts. It
seemed the one chance of escape. At the rate
the boat was going it would soon be at the
foot of the trail to the stronghold where
Salas&#8217; men would be waiting in force to
escort them up the steep incline to the top of
the mountain. A huge crocodile lay asleep
about a hundred yards ahead and this sight
had awakened the plan to action in Phil&#8217;s
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go slowly,&#8221; he whispered loud enough to
be heard by all in the boat. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if we
can&#8217;t get a shot at that big crocodile over there.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>Salas slowly drew in his paddle, laying it
across his knees, while his hand went back to
the holster strap.</p>

<p>&#8220;You keep paddling slowly, Syd, and the
se&ntilde;orita can prevent us from capsizing when
we fire,&#8221; the lad continued eagerly. His own
revolver still rested in its holster, while his
eyes were bent upon the outlaw&#8217;s hand fumbling
with the buttoned flap. Mentally he
measured the slight figure before him and
then the frail boat in which they were seated.
The terrible risk he was running came to him
almost overpoweringly. Overboard in this
river full of hungry crocodiles was unnerving
enough to those who could swim, but Maria
had said that her small brother could not,
and for him death in this swift current would
be assured. With his own paddle resting on
his knees he braced his feet cautiously but
firmly on the round of the bilge so as to put
an equal pressure on each side. The outlaw,
with his eyes on the crocodile as yet undisturbed
in his doze, had succeeded in releasing
the flap; his thumb and forefinger grasped
lightly the revolver handle, drawing it slowly,
thoughtfully, from its cover. Phil&#8217;s hand was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
partly raised, as if he held his revolver ready
to shoot at the formidable animal. He muttered
a silent prayer that the crocodile would
not awake before his plan had succeeded. He
felt that out of the corner of his eye the outlaw
was watching him, but Phil&#8217;s hope was
that his act would be so swift and unexpected
that Salas would have no time to avoid it
and jeopardize the lives of those in the boat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>CLEVERLY OUTWITTED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Salas&#8217; hand slowly drew his revolver
from its holster, Phil&#8217;s right hand with the
speed of a mongoos seizing its prey clutched
the slender wrist of the outlaw; the lad&#8217;s left
hand had moved deftly to the slack of the
native&#8217;s strong khaki trousers, and the next
second he had raised the surprised Filipino
from off his seat and held him for an instant
balanced in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn her down-stream,&#8221; the midshipman
ordered in a hoarse voice, as he flung the
struggling man into the water clear of the
rocking boat.</p>

<p>Maria by a well-timed stroke had instantly
spun the canoe about, and all four bent
desperately to their paddles. Phil saw the
broad-brimmed sombrero of their enemy floating
on the surface and a fear instantly filled
his thoughts that Salas might not swim. The
next second he was reassured; the head of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
native covered with thick black hair could be
plainly seen swimming toward the far shore;
the menacing presence of the crocodile had
deterred him from attempting to reach the
land but a few strokes away. Every second
the lad expected to hear a loud call for help
from the outraged officer. Phil, over his
shoulder, measured the distance yet to be
gained by the struggling native. Why had
he not cried out a warning to his men? Surely
they were within hearing; the trail over
which they had gone must be but a short distance
from the river.</p>

<p>Under the straining muscles of the midshipmen,
helped by the swiftness of the current,
the canoe sped toward the grassy slope where
their horses were waiting. A bend in the
river, and the swimmer disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why hasn&#8217;t he given the alarm?&#8221; Phil
demanded nervously. &#8220;What does it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will as soon as he reaches shore,&#8221;
Maria gasped breathlessly. &#8220;The monkeys
when they fall in the water always scream, so
Salas knows better than to signal to all the
crocodiles within hearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Juan, try as he would, could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
keep up with the furious pace set him by his
companions, and he lay quietly balancing
himself in the boat and gazing about him
with frightened eyes.</p>

<p>The skiff was run full speed against the
steep bank of the river, and the midshipmen
clutched eagerly the loose earth until Maria
and her brother had gained the shore. Then
to their expectant ears there came a loud
halloo! from up the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no time to be lost,&#8221; Phil urged
excitedly as he darted ahead to where their
horses had been tied. A sickening fear took
possession of him until he had climbed to the
top of the slope.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re here!&#8221; he cried joyfully, as he
saw the five horses grazing contentedly.</p>

<p>The midshipmen lifted Maria and her
brother upon the backs of their horses, cutting
loose the hempen lariats with which they had
been tethered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lead the way, se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; he cried hurriedly;
&#8220;we must not spare ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>For one second Phil lingered. The fifth
horse, if he left it there, would afford the
means of catching other horses to pursue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
them; for he knew that a single outlaw would
not dare attempt to follow. With a few swift
strokes of his knife he severed the bridle and
then with his open hand struck the restless
animal across the flanks. As he swung himself
into his saddle he saw it plunge eagerly
away into the dense jungle, happy to be again
free of its domestic yoke.</p>

<p>As the lad dashed ahead after his companions,
he heard the low moaning note of
the concha (a shell bugle), a signal of warning
used by the ladrones of the mountains.
The sound was insidious. It seemed to come
from a long way off. Yet Phil knew the
operator could not be a mile away. The low
tones were known to travel many miles, even
farther than the high notes of a bugle. To
those whose ears had not been trained to
listen to the warning note, the sound might
be mistaken for the coo of a wood pigeon.
The lad&#8217;s heart leaped as he foresaw that the
two men who had gone to bring the missing
canoe were between them and the only
avenue of escape and their trained ears had
already heard the warning sound. If they
had started back in the boat when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
heard the warning, they would remain concealed
until the fugitives had drawn within
close range and then would open fire upon
them. Even though the persons of the party
might escape the hastily aimed shots, the
great bulk of a horse could never escape and
the crippling of one animal would mean at
the least their recapture, and probably death
to all four.</p>

<p>With the energy of despair he drove his
horse forward to join those in the lead.
Breathlessly, trembling with his terrible
anxiety, he reached Maria&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know of any other road?&#8221; he
gasped. &#8220;There!&#8221; he exclaimed hopelessly,
as a low coo came from the direction of the
bungalow, &#8220;they have answered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know of a road,&#8221; the girl returned
breathlessly, &#8220;but it is across the river, and is
very narrow and uneven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gazed frantically at the swift current
as it appeared intermittently through vistas
in the trees while they sped along. Once
across undiscovered they would be safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Juan, he cannot swim; he will be
afraid,&#8221; he cried hoarsely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>&#8220;Never fear for him. It was necessary
Colonel Salas should think so in order to
persuade him to sit in front of you. He fell
into my trap very obligingly,&#8221; she returned,
a half smile curving the corners of her
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The river then is our only chance,&#8221; Phil
declared decidedly. &#8220;It will be death for us
all to attempt to pass the two armed outlaws.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These horses are all good swimmers,&#8221;
Maria answered hurriedly. &#8220;Just hold on to
the saddle and give them their heads. I
know where we can land, so follow me.
Look out for Juan,&#8221; she ended in sisterly
fear.</p>

<p>As Maria, followed by the midshipmen and
Juan, forced her horse to enter the forbidding
river, a fusillade of rifle-shots sounded from a
point in the river some thousand yards above
them, and the smack of bullets struck the water
close to the horses&#8217; forefeet. A new danger
now confronted the fugitives. Those above
them had discovered their intention to cross
the river. Fortunately as yet they were beyond
the effective range of rifles, but if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
two men at the ranch should discover the
move they were making to put the river between
them and their enemies, they could
quickly cross in their canoe and locate themselves
in the path of escape.</p>

<p>The horses drew back at first, erecting their
ears and neighing timidly, doubtless scenting
the huge crocodiles hidden in the rank
growth upon the banks.</p>

<p>Phil heaved a relieved sigh as he saw
Maria&#8217;s horse emerge from the water on the
far side, and scramble up the steep bank, the
dripping girl clutching securely the saddle.</p>

<p>Little Juan behaved like a veteran, guiding
his horse with a gentle hand across the
current until the animal&#8217;s feet took the bottom
on the other side and when the horse&#8217;s
back emerged, he was sitting again securely
in the saddle.</p>

<p>Just as Phil, the last to reach the shore,
gained the steep ascent, a sharp crack of a
rifle, followed by a loud smack as the bullet
dug itself into the muddy soil, announced
that those at the ranch had also discovered
their presence. As Phil drew himself into
the saddle shaking free his reins, a single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
swift glance down the river showed him the
two natives running toward the palm grove
where the canoe was tied. A few swift
strokes and they would again bar the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Syd, we must ride ahead,&#8221; Phil
cried in a fever of dread, as he dashed by
Maria and her brother. &#8220;Never mind what
happens, se&ntilde;orita, you ride on as fast as you can
go,&#8221; he continued earnestly as Sydney spurred
ahead to join him. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to turn those
fellows back,&#8221; he explained breathlessly. &#8220;If
they succeed in getting across they will be
able to stop us completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the midshipmen galloped madly down
the rough trail toward a clearing in the trees
from which they could get a clear view of
their enemy, both drew their revolvers and
held them in readiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out for your horse, Syd,&#8221; Phil continued;
&#8220;he&#8217;ll probably balk when we fire
and to be unseated now would mean the
end.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the two horsemen came into view of the
boat the two natives, half-way across the
river, suddenly dropped their paddles. Two
flashes of flame and a light, filmy smoke told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
that their bullets had been sent speeding in
the midshipmen&#8217;s direction. But fortunately
the rocking canoe had spoiled their aim.
The missiles sang harmlessly above the lads&#8217;
heads.</p>

<p>On a mad gallop the two midshipmen
rushed out upon the clearing, revolvers in
hand. As if on drill, the two horses were
drawn back upon their haunches and the
Americans&#8217; weapons spoke furiously&mdash;shot
after shot struck about the panic-stricken
natives. They first attempted to paddle away,
but the close hiss of the bullets became more
than their waning courage could stand. Forgetting
their rifles in their mad fear, they
jumped overboard and dived below the surface
of the water, while the empty canoe, in
the grasp of the current, went sailing swiftly
down-stream, forever beyond their reach.</p>

<p>With wild exultation the midshipmen
turned and raced after their fleeing friends.</p>

<p>Darkness overtook them long before they
could again recross the river and take the
wide trail on which it was possible to ride
with greater speed.</p>

<p>It was after midnight before the great house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
of Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez loomed up ahead, and
after they had been stopped a number of
times by the vigilant sentries they gained
the hospitable roof.</p>

<p>After a hearty supper, which Maria insisted
upon their eating, Phil declared his wish to
return to Palilo.</p>

<p>&#8220;But your boat has not returned,&#8221; Maria
insisted. &#8220;You must sleep here to-night,
then you can return in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil knew that O&#8217;Neil would not return
until he had reached a depth of water in the
river too shallow for the gunboat to pass.
How far would he have to go? Maybe to the
ca&ntilde;on beneath the insurgent stronghold. In
that case he could scarcely expect them before
morning. A slight uneasiness filled his
thoughts, but he tried to put it aside, for
O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s ready resourcefulness could get them
out of almost any difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is important, se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; Phil declared
firmly, &#8220;that I should return to-night. I will
leave a message for my men to follow down
on their return. May I have a boat or a
couple of horses?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Maria spoke a few words to an attendant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>&#8220;Lopez will guide you,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I
am sorry you will not stay, but you, of course,
know best.&#8221;</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez, after he had been told of
the miraculous escape of the explorers, shook
the lads warmly by the hand, and thanked
them for taking care of his two children.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the other way around,&#8221; Sydney
cried in admiration. &#8220;Your daughter really
saved us and herself, too. If it had not been
for her we should have blundered into a fight
with the ladrones and been killed for our
pains.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Salas, eh? So he is with Espinosa. The
two blackest rogues we have in the islands.
You are lucky to be free of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many men have you guarding your
plantation?&#8221; Phil inquired, his mind bent
upon the possibility of an attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have five hundred men, but only three
hundred rifles,&#8221; Rodriguez replied. &#8220;Captain
Blynn will send sufficient guns to arm all the
men by to-morrow. I do not fear an attack
until after Espinosa is more recovered. My
spies report that he is still suffering from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
wound. I suppose I must expect an attack
eventually,&#8221; he added sadly, gazing lovingly
at his daughter and little son.</p>

<p>Within the hour, Lopez appeared and reported
all was ready for the trip to Palilo.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want more men,&#8221; Phil suggested,
&#8220;I can speak to Major Marble, the adjutant-general.
But I, myself, hope soon to be anchored
off your house in the &#8216;Mindinao.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lopez&#8217;s old eyes opened wide. &#8220;A gunboat
has not been for many years up this river,&#8221;
he said gravely. &#8220;The Spaniards built the
bridge after the bloody fight at Matiginao
over thirty years ago. It is said that many
rocks were placed in the channel by the
natives at that time, and after the Spaniards
found the river was blocked for their gunboats
they built that bridge to endure. It is
all of stone and iron. A steam-launch can
barely pass through the archway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart sank. The channel blocked
with rock! If this was true only a careful
survey could assure safety for the gunboat.
The lead might easily miss the shallow places
while the gunboat would discover the obstruction
for the first time with its frail bottom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>The lad shook hands with the dignified old
man. They regarded him almost with reverence.
Had they not seen him stand bravely
before a score of his countrymen, who he
knew would like nothing better than to murder
him, and tell them boldly that he was for
the right even if to be so would cause him to
be called a traitor! Now he had declared for
the American cause and almost every influential
native&#8217;s hand was against him.</p>

<p>Maria went with them to where the grooms
held their horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;orita, we can never thank you
enough,&#8221; Phil declared gladly. &#8220;You are
forever putting us in your debt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you have forgotten the night you
saved Colonel Martinez,&#8221; she said softly,
and Phil imagined in the moonlight that her
eyes shone brighter.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, Phil!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed eagerly
a moment later, after they and Lopez
had swung themselves into their saddles and
were trotting down the broad roadway, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t believe it was in any girl to have such
grit, least of all one of her race. How on
earth did you come to think of such a trick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
as you played on that dapper little colonel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil smiled deliciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was planned telepathically between
the se&ntilde;orita and me,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;She
purposely sat in front of Salas and I was
placed behind him; reason one. She knew
that I knew if Salas remained in that canoe
we would all be made prisoners, and as Espinosa
would be our jailer&mdash;well! The crocodile
was sent by a kind Providence, but if not
one way it would have been another. The
idea occurred to me and I firmly believe that
she divined what I was about to do, for did
you see her spin the canoe about so as to get
out of the colonel&#8217;s reach when he was sent
floundering in the water? She first induced
him against his caution and better judgment
to trust himself alone with us in one canoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t he disarm us?&#8221; Sydney
questioned perplexedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say he wonders why he didn&#8217;t too,
by now,&#8221; Phil laughed. &#8220;Maria threw him
quite off the scent, apparently. These brown
fellows are very keen on dramatic scenes, and
he doubtless thought it would be a fine situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
to spring the fact that we were prisoners
when we had arrived in Espinosa&#8217;s presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The guide Lopez rode silently at their side.
The lads were too much occupied to give him
more than a passing thought until the road
emerged from the woods of the valley and
wound gradually around a hill which was
half-way between Rodriguez&#8217;s ranch and
Palilo. Their conversation had flagged; for
the first time they realized that they needed
sleep. After their hard ride they felt tired and
stiff. By mutual consent they stopped on the
crest of the hill. Phil took out his watch
and held it up to the moon&#8217;s rays.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two o&#8217;clock!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Not much
sleep for us to-night.&#8221; Then a look in Lopez&#8217;s
face caused him alarm. He saw the native,
eyes intent on the horizon from which they
had come and his hands pressing forward his
ears, apparently trying to intercept a sound
which he had either heard or imagined.</p>

<p>Phil was about to ask an eager question but
before he could speak he was answered by a
distant rumble from the direction of the ranch.
Again and again the slight sound trembled
on the still night. Like statues silhouetted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
against the sky, for a second or more the three
men sat transfixed with apprehension. Then
as one man they whirled their horses about and
galloped madly back over the road in the direction
from which they had come. That far-distant
sound could have but one interpretation;&mdash;the
Rodriguez ranch was being attacked,
and they might be needed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>A NIGHT OF ALARM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the midshipmen had ridden away
Maria returned to the large living-room to bid
her father good-night. A new pleasure had
come into her life, and what was more natural
than that she should wish to share it with him?
These frank, young Americans had proved
themselves to be of a quality which she had
not thought existed outside of the story-books
of her childhood. She believed that in their
friendship her father&#8217;s difficulties would melt
away. Juan Rodriguez, interested as he had
always been in the political trials of his country
together with the management of his
vast estates, from which he had reaped great
riches, like most Filipinos of the upper class,
had treated his only daughter more as a
heaven-sent treasure rather than as a daughter
to confide in and in whom to seek womanly
sympathy in his perplexities. Her principal
care had been for her brother, Juan, the pride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
of the old man&#8217;s life. Upon this seven-year-old
boy the greater part of his affection was
centred. Maria was not at all sleepy, and,
seeing a light in her father&#8217;s bedroom, she
slipped in quietly to pour out her heart to the
stern but kindly parent.</p>

<p>On the threshold she stopped in startled
amazement. Her slippered feet had made no
sound and the door as she pushed it open caused
him to glance up in annoyed surprise. She
saw her father on his knees in the corner before
several heavy iron-bound chests, and their
opened covers displayed to her anxious eyes a
great wealth of gold and silver coins. More
money than her young imagination had ever
dreamed of.</p>

<p>As Rodriguez&#8217;s eyes encountered the startled
look in his daughter&#8217;s face, an expression of
stern annoyance came into his own as he
snapped the huge lids shut and rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you keep all that money here?&#8221;
she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Her father looked worried at the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the money I have is in those chests,
daughter,&#8221; he answered in a low voice. &#8220;It has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
been buried, but when Garcia deserted me,
Lopez and I dug it up and brought it in here.
I fear these native banks, and if I should be
robbed by the insurgents I would leave you
and Juan penniless. My lands are valuable,
but these,&#8221; pointing to the chests, &#8220;contain
the most of my wealth. My ambition is to
take my children abroad, away from this turmoil
and strife where they can see the world
and be educated in a way befitting the blood
in their veins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maria put her arms about the old man&#8217;s
neck and kissed him fondly. &#8220;Father,&#8221; she
began, her eyes smiling with happiness, &#8220;I
came in to speak to you of the two young men
who have just left us. Tell them of your
troubles and I know they will be able to solve
the difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rodriguez smiled sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your knights, child, I see have already been
endowed with magic powers,&#8221; he answered lovingly,
patting her smooth black hair, &#8220;but we
have a cruel and unscrupulous enemy against
us, and I am sure by now he knows of the existence
of this treasure. Garcia and I were
the only ones who knew where it was buried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
and I trusted him as a brother but he has deserted
and betrayed me. Lopez is from the
people, but his honesty and loyalty are beyond
doubt. Captain Blynn knows that this
money is here and has promised to send a
company of soldiers to take it to safety in the
government vaults at Palilo. I had hoped he
would be here before now,&#8221; he ended in a
worried tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why bury it?&#8221; Maria exclaimed. &#8220;Our
American friends would gladly take it on the
gunboat, where it will be perfectly safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rodriguez&#8217;s face lighted up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will ask them to-morrow,&#8221; she added as
she kissed her father in parting, &#8220;and now
don&#8217;t lose any sleep over your troublesome
gold.&#8221; She turned, a happy smile on her face,
and glided noiselessly to the door, to enter her
own room; she stopped and the smile froze
on her face and the fear within her made her
faint; she clutched reeling at the door and
steadied herself. The face of a man had been
pressed against the dark glass of the window
in her room, and she knew instantly that he
had seen through the opened door the three
coveted chests of treasure. She passed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
hands across her face in horror, hoping that
it was but a trick of the imagination, conjured
up by her anxiety. But no, the face had been
too vividly distinct. As she had entered the
darkness of her room, for an instant the light
from her father&#8217;s lamp had been reflected on
the intruder&#8217;s face, and in that terrible moment
she had recognized her father&#8217;s former
confidant, but now his enemy, Garcia. She
stood panic-stricken, at a loss how to act.
To give the alarm might insure her father&#8217;s
death. Perhaps the enemy had made their
way within and were at that very moment
concealed in the great vacant rooms, lying
hidden in the darkness waiting until the
household were all asleep, and then murder
and robbery would be their aim. If she told
her father now, she knew that he would fearlessly
and at once give the alarm and call for
his armed men to protect him. Then a
thought made the blood freeze in her veins,
as her active mind sought for the means
Garcia had employed to pass her father&#8217;s sentries.
There could be but one solution.
Garcia had sowed dissension among her father&#8217;s
retainers. How many of his men could now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
be trusted? While she stood in terrified
silence, a loud knock on the outside door
caused her young body to tremble in mortal
terror. What could it mean? Who would
come at this hour in the morning? She saw
her father make ready to answer, for the servants
all slept in a house adjoining.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll open it,&#8221; she cried, trying to disguise
the tremble in her voice, and with shaking
limbs she crept down the stairs. Holding her
breath, she listened. Then she drew back the
bolts in trembling haste and threw wide the
door.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil and his tired companions, the boat&#8217;s
crew, stood in open-eyed wonder as this
wild-eyed but now joyous girl dragged them
inside and again barred the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, se&ntilde;orita?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
asked in calm surprise.</p>

<p>She put her finger to her lips and led them
into the dining-room, where the remnants of
the midshipmen&#8217;s supper still remained. The
five men fell upon the food ravenously while
Maria stood by, fear and hope in turns showing
in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>She told them of the trip up the river and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
the escape from the ladrone leader, then of
the valuable treasure in her father&#8217;s room and
the face she had seen at the window. After
she had finished she watched O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s face as
if it were an oracle and she a petitioner before
it. The boatswain&#8217;s mate ate for several minutes
in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are your men posted?&#8221; he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are divided into four companies, one
at each of the outposts,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does any one except your father and
Colonel Martinez know of Garcia&#8217;s treachery?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, two, Lopez and Lukban,&#8221; she replied,
&#8220;and they are both away from the ranch.
Lopez has just gone to Palilo with our
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad,&#8221; the sailor exclaimed, a cloud
on his otherwise expressionless face. &#8220;Then
your men believe that Garcia is still their
friend? He has, of course, accomplices among
them and his object surely must be the treasure.
He has discovered that it has been dug
up, and now knows it is in your father&#8217;s room.
I do not believe there is any immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
danger unless at the same time the insurgents
are to make an attack in force.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl listened eagerly, nodding her head
in agreement with the wise words of this cool
and calm American. O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s companions,
understanding no Spanish, had finished their
meal and were dozing contentedly in their
chairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a servant you can trust?&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil asked after a moment&#8217;s thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;My maid, Inez,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; give her a revolver and tell her
to go to each company and quietly wake the
men and tell them to get ready immediately
to repel an attack. If she is in danger of being
captured by a lurking enemy tell her to
use the revolver. I&#8217;ll leave two men with
you and your father, while I&#8217;ll take two to
try to bag this Garcia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maria listened eagerly, hope rising as the
sailor clearly outlined his plan of action.
She was sure Inez could be depended upon.
Quietly she flew up the stairs. As she passed
her father&#8217;s room she saw that he had retired,
but had left the light burning for her. She
stopped a second, listening to his easy breathing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
He was asleep. Then she went through
her own room, a chill passing through her as
her eyes turned in fear toward the window.</p>

<p>She took hold of Inez&#8217;s arm and shook her
into wakefulness. The old woman, who had
nursed Maria as a baby, sat up rubbing the
sleep out of her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet,&#8221; Maria whispered in a commanding
voice. &#8220;We are all in danger of
being murdered. I want you to take this
revolver and go to each outpost, tell the officer
on guard that it is Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez&#8217;s
order to form his men to repel an attack at
once. If you fail fire the revolver as a
signal to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman rose to her feet trembling
violently. She counted her beads, murmuring
her prayers, but there was never a word
of fear or hesitancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, Inez,&#8221; Maria whispered, kissing
the old wrinkled face. The girl saw it was
set determinedly, yet a great and unknown
terror looked out of her appealing
eyes. But the girl knew that she would be
the safest messenger. No one else could be
depended upon like Inez, and she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
sacrifice her old life willingly to help her
beloved master.</p>

<p>When Maria again entered the dining-room
O&#8217;Neil had turned out the lamp and was
ready to carry out his daring plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two of my men will remain here with
you, se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; he told Maria as she held
open the door. &#8220;We&#8217;ll soon bag this fellow
Garcia, if he&#8217;s still hanging about.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil, followed cautiously by his two men,
walked slowly about the great house. As
noiselessly as Indians they crept within its
shadow, straining their eyes toward the portico
and covered porches above their heads. There
still remained the light in the room above
where the girl and her two protectors were
doubtless now guarding her father and his
treasure. While O&#8217;Neil stood listening eagerly,
a shadow crossed the windows; it moved
slowly inch by inch. The house was silent.
Off to his left O&#8217;Neil could hear a babble of
excited voices and the rattle of military accoutrements.
Inez&#8217;s warning had been given
and the native soldiers were hastening to their
stations to repel an enemy. The shadow
slowly crossed and disappeared and then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
light was suddenly extinguished. O&#8217;Neil was
about to seek further when a noise from above
arrested his attention. He recognized at once
that a sash was being opened slowly. Then
as he watched a dark figure appeared and
dropped noiselessly to the porch roof a few feet
below the window. Quietly it lowered itself
to the edge of the roof and then with the
agility of an acrobat or a sailor climbed down
the post near which the boatswain&#8217;s mate and
his men were standing. The next moment
two powerful arms enfolded it and a cry of
fear was promptly stifled.</p>

<p>Then from the dark shadow of the woods to
the northward came a volley of musketry, followed
by the war-cry of the bolo-man.</p>

<p>Hastily binding their prisoner with their
neckerchiefs, the sailors flung him on to the
porch and rushed to join the defenders scarcely
four hundred yards away. Rodriguez had
carefully laid out his plan of defense, and before
the attacking enemy could come to a hand
to hand fight, over three hundred yards of
cleared land must be traversed. As O&#8217;Neil
and his men reached the trenches where the
native soldiers were excitedly firing blindly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
into the night, he could see a bobbing line of
men rapidly running across this open space,
firing as they advanced. Hastily surveying
his surroundings, he saw that on one flank
was the river defended by a company of men
and on the flank away from the river was still
another company. The excited native officers
were shouting orders to their men, the purport
of which O&#8217;Neil could but guess. The
bobbing figures seemed in vast numbers and
they advanced rapidly in spite of the fire from
the trenches. Suddenly the company from
the river bank left its post and came at double
time to the middle of the line of defense.
O&#8217;Neil and his men had seized a rifle each
from lifeless hands and were elbow to elbow&mdash;vociferously
haranguing the men, cautioning
them to aim at the constantly moving enemy.
Before they could realize its significance, a
line of men arose suddenly from the short
grass, only a few score of yards in front of the
trenches, to which point they had crawled
unobserved, while the defenders had been firing
at the visible enemy. The next second
this avalanche of naked humanity had cleared
the intervening yards and were hacking at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
surprised defenders with their sharp bolos.
Their friends in their rear still kept up a
brisk fire and many of the bolo-men suffered
by it. O&#8217;Neil suddenly found himself occupied
by three fanatics bent upon his destruction,
while his companions near him were in
as perilous a position. Throwing away his
empty rifle he drew his revolver and fired unerringly
at the nearest native. Then seizing
the fallen man&#8217;s bolo he rushed upon his
other two assailants. So fierce had been the
onslaught of the bolo-men that they had
surged into and even beyond the rifle-pits,
leaving a trail of destruction in their path.</p>

<p>The bolo-men, now at close quarters with
those in the trenches, made good use of their
keen-bladed knives, but Rodriguez&#8217;s men, familiar
with the method of attack of these fanatics,
appeared to flee, and then turning shot their
would-be pursuers down by the score. O&#8217;Neil
and his companions were in these few exciting
minutes many times in peril of their lives
but soon the last of the attacking horde lay
gasping on the grass behind the intrenchment
and the sailors and their dusky allies were
again in comparative security awaiting grimly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
the final attack of the bobbing figures some
hundreds of yards in their front, from whose
direction a hail of bullets whistled incessantly.
O&#8217;Neil felt himself all over hardly believing
that he had escaped unscathed. The sailor
during his many years of service had never
seen a fight more desperate. He had frequently
heard of the insurgent method of employing
bolo-men; using their riflemen as a
screen, the practically unarmed horde, who believed
that their &#8220;Anting-Anting&#8221; charms
rendered them invulnerable, crawling snake-like,
unobserved beyond their firing line until
they reached the rifle-pits of their enemy. Now
he felt sure the attack on the ranch would fail.
Rodriguez&#8217;s natives had successfully weathered
the bolo rush, which they had learned to
fear most. He did not know the numbers of
the attackers, but if they could be held off
until morning the soldiers who had been
promised from Palilo to guard Rodriguez&#8217;s
treasure would surely be there to turn the tide
in their favor. By the fire from the trenches
surrounding the ranch house on all sides except
that covered by the river, beyond which
was an impenetrable swamp, he knew that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
their line had not been broken. With a
lighter heart he counseled the natives near
him to be careful of their ammunition, setting
them an example by firing deliberately only
when a target native exposed himself in the
clearing in front of them. So much occupied
were those in the trenches that they failed to
see several great canoes land near the pier, and
their occupants in single file noiselessly steal
toward the ranch house.</p>

<p>Again and again the insurgents made their
onslaught, but each time were received unflinchingly
and driven back in confusion
across the cleared ground, many being left dead
or dying on the field.</p>

<p>A disheveled, terrified figure came running
from the house toward the trenches; it glanced
about wildly seeking some one and then
threw itself at O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s feet, clasping his legs
tightly, almost upsetting him among the stiffening
bodies of the dead on the floor of the
trench. In the dim light he recognized the
woman Inez who had courageously spread the
alarm among the native soldiers and her incoherent
words filled the sailor&#8217;s heart with
dire forebodings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>&#8220;Oh, se&ntilde;or, save my master,&#8221; she cried; &#8220;he
is in mortal danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil bent down and unclasped the
woman&#8217;s hands and lifted her to her feet,
but her body crumpled and the American
saw with a sob of horror that Inez had done
her last service to the Rodriguez family;
a bolo cut on her old body had claimed her
among the victims slain in this unnecessary
war.</p>

<p>The boatswain&#8217;s mate laid the woman&#8217;s
body aside and with a score of willing men
started on a run for the house. Half-way
there they stopped precipitously, hardly believing
their eyes, a great fear in their hearts,
for from the river there came a noiseless band
of men, dim shadows under the gloom of the
trees. O&#8217;Neil counted them as their silhouettes
crossed a vista in the trees, and his hopes
died within him. Here was a new enemy,
striking from the rear. The men in the
trenches could not leave their positions; to do
so would allow many hundreds of the insurgents
to sweep the ranch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;we must reach the
ranch house first.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>He saw that this was their only hope to
save the inmates.</p>

<p>Then a cry of joy leaped from his lips as
tongues of flame leaped from the vicinity of
the house, directed upon the advancing men
from the river. He heard an order given
sharply in the English tongue and a volley
shattered the darkness asunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;American soldiers!&#8221; he cried jubilantly.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil and his men had meanwhile circled
away from the river in hopes of making a
rush for an entrance; now with sudden consternation
O&#8217;Neil saw that the appearance of
the soldiers from the river would place him
in the line of retreat of those now surrounding
the ranch house. Selecting the protection
of a tree trunk he called upon his men to
do likewise. He heard the order &#8220;Charge&#8221;
given in the silvery peals of a bugle and the
next moment the terrified natives were fleeing
directly toward him, the hindmost slashing
with their bolos those in front of them in
their mad haste to seek safety. Then the
drumming of hoof-beats was heard and three
horsemen appeared suddenly from the night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
emptying their revolvers as they came into
the fleeing savages.</p>

<p>A woman&#8217;s scream pierced the night and the
figure of a man silently dropped from the
roof and disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>A FILIPINO MARTYR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> and Sydney were hard pushed to
keep up with the native as he spurred his
horse forward over the dark road.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ranch is being attacked!&#8221; Lopez
cried in a voice of fear. &#8220;My poor master will
surely be killed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s thoughts were only for the frail girl
whom he had begun to look upon as his own
especial charge. He knew the cruelty of the
Filipinos when once their anger was aroused
and he believed that her part in Espinosa&#8217;s
betrayal must now be known to that treacherous
leader. Probably Colonel Salas himself
formed a part of the attacking force, and
the lad thought fearfully of the vengeance he
would take upon the helpless girl if she fell
into his hands. As they approached the
ranch, the volume of fire increased alarmingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are in force!&#8221; Phil exclaimed, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
heart sinking within him as he urged his
tired mount forward.</p>

<p>The ranch with its surrounding orchard of
fruit trees now lay just below them and the
white road winding down the hill glistened
in the dim moonlight. Tongues of flame
darted here and there from the shadows of
trees and shrub, even close to the house itself,
while further in the background toward the
river a line of flame resembling fireflies on a
summer evening told him the soldiers of
Rodriguez were stubbornly resisting the main
attack from their solidly built trenches. As
they plunged madly down the hill road, his
alert eyes tried to disentangle the situation.
He saw many moving figures flitting through
the trees, the moonlight glinting on their
bright bladed bolos, while toward the river a
long line of flashing rifles told of a rescue
party approaching, from whom the flitting
figures were fleeing.</p>

<p>Three white figures appeared suddenly from
behind a tree close to the retreating bolo-men
and the lad&#8217;s heart gave a great leap of joy as
he recognized even in the dim light the stalwart
figure of O&#8217;Neil.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>Then as he charged forward with his companions
close beside him, Maria&#8217;s cry made
his heart sink and at the same instant he saw
the figure of a man emerge from the house
and dart away after the retreating bolo-men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we needed?&#8221; a familiar voice
shouted from the company which had now
halted at the house, and the anxious lads,
after firing their revolvers in vain at the fleeing
figure, were shaking Captain Blynn&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the trenches, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil volunteered
eagerly. &#8220;They are hard pushed, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn gave a hurried order and
his company of American soldiers rushed
eagerly toward the thick of the firing, followed
by O&#8217;Neil and his men. All were
eager to again try conclusions with the elusive
foe.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney followed the anxious
Lopez to the house. As they entered the hall
they were horrified to find everything in confusion.
The furniture was wrecked in many
places, and there were blood-stains on floor
and wall, showing there had been a terrible
struggle. A light was burning dimly in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
alcove. In the corner lay the white form of
an American sailor mutilated and dead.
Further up the stairs they saw the other poor
sailor breathing his last. Clearing the body
with a bound the lads gazed with sinking
heart upon the dead face of Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez,
lying on the floor of his bedroom, while all
about him was confusion and ruin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the girl?&#8221; Sydney asked in a
faint, fearful voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;orita!&#8221; Phil called hopelessly.</p>

<p>A faint sob came to their ears from an
inner room. Rushing in they found the girl
on the floor, her hands and feet securely
bound. About her mouth a gag had been
placed, but it had fallen, leaving the mouth
free.</p>

<p>They quickly released her and placed her
tenderly on the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;She managed to get off the gag and
scream,&#8221; Phil whispered with admiration, &#8220;before
she fainted. Bring that light, Syd, she
may be hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>The light was soon brought, and the lads
were relieved to find that she was unharmed.</p>

<p>Lopez meanwhile had stayed at the bedside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
of his dead master, moaning piteously. The
noise caught the girl&#8217;s ear as she awaked
from her stupor under the administration of
the midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Espinosa himself,&#8221; she exclaimed
in an anguish of sorrow. &#8220;They forced the
door and killed the brave sailors. My father
defended himself but he is no match for five
men. Espinosa struck him down from behind.
I ran to guard little Juan, but they
caught me and bound me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The money is gone too,&#8221; groaned Lopez.
This to him seemed as great a sorrow as the
death of his master.</p>

<p>&#8220;They lowered it out the window,&#8221; Maria
said. She entered her father&#8217;s room, walking
unsteadily between the two midshipmen, and
knelt in prayer before her father&#8217;s couch.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s eyes fell before those of the girl as
she arose dry-eyed and calm. He saw the
anguish in her face, however, and vowed that
he would lighten her task wherever it lay in
his power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Juan safe?&#8221; Lopez asked suddenly, his
mind at last grasping the horrible calamity
which had fallen on his master&#8217;s house and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
realizing that his first duty was with the
living.</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inez brought the alarm that the house
was surrounded. She hid the boy and herself.
Espinosa searched for him and his intention
was to carry us both away as his
prisoners.&#8221; Then a sudden fear came into
her voice and her eyes flashed with excited
terror. &#8220;He said that Colonel Martinez had
been killed. Is it so?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads shook their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no news, Maria,&#8221; Phil said
kindly. &#8220;No, it cannot be so. It was but
prompted by this cruel man to taunt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he had known of this attack and was
alive he would have prevented it,&#8221; she exclaimed
suddenly, her hope turning to dejection.</p>

<p>While they were talking the fusillade
slowly diminished and soon ceased altogether
and in a short time Captain Blynn&#8217;s voice
was heard in the hall below.</p>

<p>In the large living-room the army and
navy men sat, until the daylight sifted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
through the shell windows, talking of the
perplexing situation, while Maria was made
to go to bed and sleep. The doctor who accompanied
the captain regarded her with eyes
of grave concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;She must not be overexcited. She is
outwardly calm but her heart acts queerly.
It may snap at any moment,&#8221; he had told
the lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have received a long letter from your
friend, Colonel Martinez,&#8221; the captain exclaimed
to the midshipmen after disposing of
a steaming cup of coffee. &#8220;He said he would
willingly surrender to General Wilson if the
price on his head were removed, and he sent
me papers and documents which I have
already sent to the governor-general in
Manila which prove Martinez&#8217;s innocence of
certain crimes committed in Luzon and implicate
a Filipino now high in the good
graces of the government.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil thoughtfully sent Lopez to Maria to
tell her of Captain Blynn&#8217;s news and then
gave Captain Blynn the story of the recent
tragedy on the floor above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Rodriguez,&#8221; the captain murmured.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
&#8220;If he had taken the other side he would
now be alive. The money,&#8221; he added, his
face troubled&mdash;&#8220;I am too late. I promised
him I would come, but I was delayed by important
matters with the general.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A search at once,&#8221; Phil exclaimed rising
hastily from his chair; &#8220;they can&#8217;t have gone
far with those heavy chests.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lopez smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;or, it would be impossible to follow
them. By now the treasure is either carefully
hidden or else in a banka hurrying up
the river to Espinosa&#8217;s stronghold. We must
capture Espinosa; where he is the money will
be also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right, Lopez,&#8221; Captain Blynn agreed.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not pleasant to hike in this country at
night either, young man,&#8221; he added to Phil,
whose sudden show of excitement in the
prospect of another fight had died down;
&#8220;every trail is trapped, and I don&#8217;t relish a
green bamboo spear through me even for all
old Rodriguez&#8217;s money. Espinosa undoubtedly
has planned this attack carefully and in the
darkness we would simply be wasting our
time and be losing sleep.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;Some of our friend Espinosa&#8217;s plotting, in
the light of this affair, is now quite plain.
Rodriguez was in his way, and so is Martinez,
but I don&#8217;t exactly see why; and this attack
was made easy through his winning of
Garcia, the trusted friend of Rodriguez.
But how did he learn of this money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, a scowl on his
face, &#8220;Lopez tells me that Garcia alone knew
of its existence and coveted it, and readily
persuaded Espinosa to help him obtain it and
share it. With that amount of money they
can make this war very difficult for us or
they can escape with their booty to Hongkong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the captain yawning outright,
&#8220;I must get some sleep. The bridge
is clear; I&#8217;ll wait here until you bring up the
gunboat. The general is coming himself to
look over the ground. We&#8217;ve had reports
that the rebel army is massing at Matiginao,
where supplies for a year have been collected.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have the biggest fight in
the history of the war,&#8221; he added in a sleepy
voice as he lay full length on the wicker
lounge. &#8220;By the way, old man Tillotson
promises all kinds of rewards to any one who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
will rescue his son. He&#8217;s coming down himself&mdash;sailed
from Manila the day after he got
the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although the midshipmen and their men
would have liked nothing better than to
follow Captain Blynn&#8217;s example for a few
hours&#8217; nap, they felt that the startling news
that the entire rebel army was collecting
upon Matiginao made it imperative for them
to leave the situation at the Rodriguez ranch
in the hands of Captain Blynn and return to
their gunboat. So far their work had not
been crowned with success. True, they had
exposed a traitor, but in doing so the American
soldiers had acquired a new and sagacious
enemy in Espinosa. The remaining members
of the Katipunan society had taken flight,
and had fled before the vengeance of Captain
Blynn whom they all hated and feared.
Rodriguez had been killed, and enough gold
to continue the war indefinitely had been
taken almost before their eyes, and they had
been powerless to prevent it. This was not a
pleasant retrospective dream in which to indulge
as they watched in silence the even
breathing of the complacent army man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>&#8220;We seem so powerless against them,&#8221;
Sydney complained. &#8220;Our enemies are everywhere.
One moment the natives about us
seem friendly, and the next they are sticking
us in the back with knives. When we start
on an expedition the enemy know just how
many men we have and where we are going,
so there can be no surprise, while they always
take us unawares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But now, it&#8217;s different since Espinosa and
the Katipunans have been forced to leave
Palilo,&#8221; Phil exclaimed. &#8220;In the last few
days Captain Blynn says our soldiers in the
provinces have surprised several bands of insurgents.
So you see they have ceased to be
kept posted by spies at headquarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Espinosa is collecting all his men in
Matiginao with the idea of safety and a hope
of being able to capture Palilo before the two
extra regiments arrive, but General Wilson
will checkmate him by withdrawing half his
men to surround him in his mountain stronghold.
Now we have some chance; before,
they simply knew when we were coming, and
if they couldn&#8217;t meet us with three times our
number they kept out of the way. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
come,&#8221; he added suddenly jumping to his
feet, &#8220;we are wasting time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Americans returned down the river in
their cutter, this time the midshipmen taking
turns at the oars, and it was nearly eight
o&#8217;clock before they stood once more on the
deck of the &#8220;Mindinao.&#8221; The bodies of the
dead sailors were sent at once to the army
hospital for burial.</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Marble has been here twice to see
you, sir,&#8221; the quartermaster informed Phil;
&#8220;he said he&#8217;d return again in an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Breakfast first,&#8221; Phil shouted to the
Chinese steward, who came aft, smiling
blandly at the return of his officers, steaming
coffee in hand.</p>

<p>While they were still at table Major Marble
arrived, and was told all the news of the
river.</p>

<p>&#8220;The audacity of those beggars,&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;attacking in force within ten miles
of headquarters. It&#8217;s a shame, the few men
we are allowed to cover this entire country.
The general sees now that what is needed is
concentration, but if we withdraw our entire
garrisons from the towns it will mean that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
the innocent people there who have befriended
us will suffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you are right, major,&#8221; Phil
said thoughtfully, &#8220;but in war it seems to me
that one can&#8217;t stop to consider the feelings of
innocent people where the success of the cause
is concerned. Espinosa has twice as many
troops as the general, and they are fighting
on their home soil. They know every footpath.
Some are not armed with a rifle but
are far more dangerous to us with their bolos
and fanatical bravery. We did not see his
stronghold, I am glad to say,&#8221; he smiled
grimly at the words, &#8220;but we know that one
thousand men held it successfully against five
times that number of Spaniards a generation
ago. From what I have seen I say concentrate
every available man and crush this fellow
Espinosa before he gets any stronger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Marble nodded his head in agreement
with the views of the young navy
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could always do what our military
training dictates,&#8221; he answered sadly, &#8220;this
war might not have begun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go up the river in an hour,&#8221; Phil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
announced, &#8220;and if the general wishes I shall
be honored to have him on board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The general is waiting anxiously to know
that,&#8221; the major replied promptly; &#8220;that was
my mission here, but your exploits so interested
me I had nearly forgotten my mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within the hour the &#8220;Mindinao,&#8221; flying
the blue flag with one white star at her main
truck in honor of her distinguished passenger,
General Wilson, cast off from the dock and
steamed up the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a fine piece of work,&#8221; Phil exclaimed
in admiration, as he examined the
cleverly constructed drawbridge built within
the twenty-four hours by the army engineers.
Its width was just sufficient to admit the
&#8220;Mindinao.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil stood on the bridge beside the man at
the wheel, piloting the gunboat through the
ever-changing shoals, while O&#8217;Neil in person
heaved the lead in the chains, calling out the
depth in feet.</p>

<p>After leaving the town the river ran
through several miles of nipa swamp land,
the home of the carnivorous land crab,
the crocodile and the bandit Filipino. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
gunboat continued cautiously, Phil keeping
the sharp bow within the deep water, sometimes
so close to the thickly wooded shore
that he could have reached out and touched
with his hand the overhanging trees.</p>

<p>Before noon the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; had anchored
off Rodriguez&#8217;s ranch and the general and
party were landed to view the scene of the
recent fight. The shore was lined with curious
and excited natives, those of Rodriguez&#8217;s men,
who had been spared from the fierce attack.
To them the presence of the gunboat so far up
the river was almost a miracle. They pointed
knowingly at the big guns and clapped their
hands in savage joy at the thought of what
they could do against the enemy.</p>

<p>Captain Blynn had taken the situation in
hand and had distributed the soldiers of his
company to reinforce the native companies.
A feeling of relief was now manifested by all.
They were confident that no attack would be
attempted while the gunboat&#8217;s guns frowned
menacingly out there in the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s worth a regiment,&#8221; Captain Blynn
exclaimed as he saluted the general and
helped him from the &#8220;Mindinao&#8217;s&#8221; cutter to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
the bamboo pier, pointing to the graceful
white ship, standing sharply against the dark
background of jungle grass and banana trees.
As they walked toward the house Captain
Blynn dropped behind and took Phil&#8217;s arm
confidingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;After you had gone my men found a native
tied up in all sorts of sailor knots with
silk neckerchiefs, just under Rodriguez&#8217;s window.
Se&ntilde;orita Rodriguez recognized him at
once as a former friend of her father who
she said had betrayed him. He was pretty
well frightened and to save his skin, for he believes
we are going to kill him, he has offered
to show us the trail to Espinosa&#8217;s stronghold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil shook his head in mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how he got there, unless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He turned and called O&#8217;Neil from
the boat. &#8220;O&#8217;Neil, do you know anything
about a native securely bound with sailor
neckerchiefs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, sir. It was the one that crawled out
of the window,&#8221; he explained hastily; &#8220;the
young lady saw his face spying on her father.
His name is Garcia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; the captain said knowingly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
&#8220;that he is the only prisoner captured?
There wasn&#8217;t a single wounded man in sight
this morning. It isn&#8217;t the custom of the country,
you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil involuntarily shuddered. &#8220;How callous
one becomes,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;in war time.
Think of maybe a hundred wounded men
cruelly butchered by brother natives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before they reached the house the party was
startled by a rifle-shot from behind them.
Glancing about quickly they saw a large canoe
manned by natives appear from behind the
trees and paddle directly for the gunboat; a
large white flag flew prominently from the
bow of the boat. Phil and Captain Blynn
walked quickly back and sent O&#8217;Neil and his
cutter out to learn the meaning of the flag of
truce. The general and the rest of the party
halted and waited, eager to see what this
strange move might mean.</p>

<p>The boat came quickly back and Phil took
a letter from a native&#8217;s hand scanning it
with beating heart. &#8220;For the general,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>All watched the general break the seal and
fumble with his glasses. It seemed ages before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
he finished the few short lines and handed
the letter to Captain Blynn.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Tillotson is my prisoner. I
will surrender him safely in exchange for the
deserter Colonel Martinez. If you attack me
I shall have him shot.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Espinosa.</span>&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>A DARING PLAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> stood silently by, his mind occupied
over the details of a daring plan.</p>

<p>The exchange proposed by Espinosa was out
of the question, even if Colonel Martinez had
surrendered, which he had not done up to the
present time; and until his sins in Luzon
were forgiven Phil knew that he preferred his
liberty. But this threat against Tillotson&#8217;s
life worried Phil. Espinosa was sufficiently
cruel to carry it out, he was sure.</p>

<p>Leaving the group of officers, who were still
pondering over the contents of Espinosa&#8217;s
communication, Phil went in search of Maria.
There were points in his plan which she could
throw light upon.</p>

<p>He found her in the house, heavy-eyed with
sorrow and loss of sleep, but she greeted him
with a smile and waited patiently until the
room was empty before signing him to speak,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
for she saw that he had something of importance
to communicate.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much dependence can we put upon
Garcia as a guide?&#8221; he asked eagerly. &#8220;I
have a plan, and all depends upon whether
he can be trusted to lead us against Espinosa,
if not willingly, then under intimidation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before they killed my father and carried
away the treasure,&#8221; the girl answered, a spark
of excitement entering her dull eyes, &#8220;Espinosa
and Salas got the information necessary
for their work from Garcia, bound and
helpless where your sailors had left him.
They refused to liberate him and hoped he
would be killed by the Americans. You
can be sure,&#8221; she added, &#8220;that he will
take keen pleasure in running his enemies to
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now for my favor from you,&#8221; the
lad continued in a lower tone; &#8220;as Garcia will
take Lopez&#8217;s place as guide for the soldiers to
the trail up the mountain, I want twenty-five
of your men whom you would trust to the
death, under the command of Lopez, to take
O&#8217;Neil and me as prisoners to Espinosa&#8217;s
camp.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>The girl gave a low exclamation of surprised
horror, regarding Phil fixedly, half
believing the lad was out of his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean it,&#8221; he exclaimed earnestly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the only chance we have of saving Tillotson&#8217;s
life. Your men must pretend to have deserted
after the death of their master,&#8221; he
dropped his voice as he saw the look of pain
in Maria&#8217;s eyes at the mention of her father&#8217;s
sad fate. &#8220;Lopez will claim to have taken us
prisoners and then deserted to the insurgents.
It&#8217;s a good plan,&#8221; he cried enthusiastically,
&#8220;and is sure to be successful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maria paled at the mere thought of such
rashness, but seeing Phil could not be moved
from his avowed intention, she gave her consent
grudgingly.</p>

<p>The general was not so easily convinced.
His natural and inherent cautiousness could
not be changed even under the combined persuasion
of the midshipman and his staff officers,
Major Marble and Captain Blynn, who
were both enthusiastic over the conception of
such a daring strategy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very impertinence of it will make it
successful,&#8221; Major Marble exclaimed. &#8220;They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
will not believe that one could be so rash as
to willingly place his life in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to stay with the gunboat,&#8221;
Phil explained to Sydney, who was visibly
put out that he too could not be allowed to
go. &#8220;I shall take only O&#8217;Neil. The general
has ordered that all the soldiers who can be
spared from the garrisons throughout the
island be despatched to rendezvous here and
will need the &#8216;Mindinao&#8217; to carry troops and
shell the stronghold from the river. If you
find it possible take her through the ca&ntilde;on;
there is a trail on the other side from the
westward. If you are successful we shall
have them between our two parties.&#8221;</p>

<p>That evening Maria and her small brother
followed their father&#8217;s body to his grave in
the family cemetery. The general himself
read the solemn burial service and a company
of American infantry fired three volleys over
the grave of the murdered patriot.</p>

<p>General Wilson established his field headquarters
in the house of mourning and before
three o&#8217;clock of the next day the first of the
detachments of soldiers arrived and went into
camp on the river slope.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>&#8220;We shall have about one thousand rifles
for the attack,&#8221; Captain Blynn told the midshipmen,
after Phil had unfolded to him and
Major Marble the details of his plan to rescue
Lieutenant Tillotson, &#8220;and by to-morrow
afternoon they should all be assembled here.
The general,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is very much
worked up over Espinosa&#8217;s threat, and realizes
that it is not an empty one, but he still refuses
to allow you to take this terrible chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within a short time Phil was summoned to
the general&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot allow you to take this risk,&#8221; he
said kindly, a light of admiration in his eyes.
&#8220;Why should two American lives be jeopardized
to save one? And perhaps some will
say that Lieutenant Tillotson does not deserve
such a sacrifice at your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That makes me more anxious to take the
risk,&#8221; Phil urged. &#8220;We did not part friends,
and I can&#8217;t help feeling that our quarrel has
had some part in his misfortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the confiding influence of the general&#8217;s
manner, Phil told of his affair with
Tillotson, doing his best to make a good case
for his one time enemy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>The general shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very hard for me to allow you to undertake
such a rash adventure,&#8221; he answered, putting
his hand affectionately on the midshipman&#8217;s
shoulder, &#8220;but war is war, and if pluck
will bring success, Tillotson&#8217;s life will be
saved. Tell me now,&#8221; he added, seating himself
and motioning Phil to a chair, &#8220;how far
you have worked out the details of your plan,
for every point must be covered; there must
be no loophole for failure. Can you expect
that each of your twenty-five men will keep the
secret after they have mixed with the enemy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil outlined each step as he had thought
it out during the last anxious twenty-four
hours, while the general listened, his face
grave and thoughtful.</p>

<p>They would start after nightfall, and by
sending men ahead to announce their coming
would be received by the insurgents with acclamation.
They would spend the next day
at the camp and Lopez would endeavor to
keep his men from mixing with the enemy,
and the next night the gunboat and as many
troops as the general could muster would lay
siege to the stronghold. The remainder Phil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
had not thought out. Chance alone must decide
the outcome, but he hoped to save Lieutenant
Tillotson&#8217;s life and their own, and
maybe by Lopez and his men commanding
the top of the trail they could aid the American
troops in their fight for the stronghold.
When the attack was made he would use
Lopez&#8217;s men to prevent Espinosa from carrying
out his threat against Tillotson&#8217;s life.
The gunboat must use its fire against the
fortifications, but be careful to direct its shell
to the left of the stronghold, for he hoped
that his own men would be at the right near
the trail leading down the precipice.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are a great many chances for
failure,&#8221; the general said thoughtfully as Phil
finished, &#8220;but with your energy and perseverance
I believe you will win.&#8221; He shook the
lad&#8217;s hand warmly in parting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could go with you,&#8221; Maria said
sadly as Phil bade her good-bye; &#8220;but you
can put your full trust in Lopez. It was he
who betrayed the Katipunan society to me to
save my father&#8217;s life. How he got the information
I do not know, but if his act were known
his life would be forfeited.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>Without ceremony Phil and O&#8217;Neil, their
hands tied securely with ropes made fast to
their bodies and held in the hands of the
make-believe deserting natives, filed along the
narrow trail leading parallel to the fast flowing
river. Two messengers had been sent
ahead to notify the insurgent leader of
the joyful tidings of the important captures.
Their progress was rapid, and inside of three
hours the house which had been the scene of
Phil&#8217;s and Maria&#8217;s strategy was reached. There
the party waited.</p>

<p>After what seemed an interminable time to
the anxious prisoners, a challenge suddenly
broke the stillness of the dismal woods and
Phil&#8217;s old enemy, Colonel Salas, stood before
him. A great joy shone from his
dark vengeful eyes as he beheld the bound
prisoners.</p>

<p>&#8220;My chief will be delighted to receive such
distinguished visitors,&#8221; he laughed, kicking
Phil viciously as he lay helpless upon the
ground. &#8220;That is for your cleverness of yesterday,&#8221;
he snarled. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see you are
kindly treated. We shall give you all the refined
initiations that we can think of to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
your stay with us pleasant and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
stopped with a significant gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Phil whispered after Colonel Salas
had left him to join Lopez, who had assembled
his men ready to advance, &#8220;I am afraid we
are in for a pretty bad time of it. But if I ever
get the opportunity I&#8217;ll make that little brown
piece of pomposity pay for that kick he gave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied evasively, &#8220;I
may have been in worse situations&mdash;no doubt
I have&mdash;but this one seems rather more complicated.
I think we&#8217;ll have many kicks and
worse to pay back before we can call our bodies
our own and not footballs for these little brown
brothers to score with.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a rapid parley the party were again in
motion. Phil and O&#8217;Neil were roughly seized
by two natives and forced ahead up the trail.
Two or three times Phil&#8217;s foot slipped into
yawning holes at either side of the trail, but
each time he was dragged back to safety by
the natives behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This whole place is trapped,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
whispered, pointing to where his foot had uncovered
the top of a square hole some six feet
deep, the lantern carried by a man in front betraying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
to view the green bamboo spears at the
bottom.</p>

<p>Phil shivered as he gazed down on the
pointed sticks as sharp as a needle, and
poisoned, he knew, with a deadly vegetable
sap that would kill within the hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful, Mr. Perry,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cautioned
in a low, anxious voice. &#8220;These men know
where the traps are, and will try to catch you
if you make a misstep&mdash;but they might fail,&#8221;
he added with a shudder.</p>

<p>A halt was called suddenly as they moved
through a densely wooded section of the level
trail, while several of Colonel Salas&#8217; men
moved cautiously ahead and appeared to
work quietly in the jungle. After a few
minutes they reappeared and signaled for the
column to proceed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spring traps,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil informed the midshipman.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve detached them from
their springs. If we hadn&#8217;t known they were
there one of us would have caught his foot in
a piece of innocent looking vine which would
have pulled a trigger and sent twenty or
more spears across the trail with force sufficient
to penetrate a pine board.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>Phil half wished that he had not volunteered
for this nerve-racking ordeal. After
all what did he owe Tillotson? Had not the
army man tried to injure him in every way?
Yet the lad knew for that very reason he had
asked to be allowed to risk his own life to
rescue him. Then he thought suddenly of
O&#8217;Neil. His stalwart form was just ahead of
him, dimly outlined in the darkness. Had
he acted generously to this brave and willing
sailor?</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil, I am mighty sorry I brought you
along,&#8221; he exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil stopped in his tracks so suddenly
that the two brown men bumped their heads
with some force against his back and cried
out with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir!&#8221; he answered in an aggrieved
tone. &#8220;Have I done anything to displease
you, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil laughed outright, only to be prodded
by the sharp bayonets of his captors for his
incautiousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the way you feel about it,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I am glad you are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inside of ten minutes, conversation was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
impossible, for they needed all their breath
for the precipitous climb up the face of the
cliff leading to the top of the mountain. The
natives on each side of the prisoners pulled
and pushed them up the jagged and rocky
trail until their bodies were bruised and their
skin torn in many places by the cruel cactus
and &#8220;Spanish bayonet,&#8221; which seemed to
have been planted by nature as a further
difficulty for those who dared to ascend the
secret trail to the insurgent stronghold.</p>

<p>After many rests, out of breath, footsore,
bleeding and tired, the top was reached and
with scant courtesy O&#8217;Neil and Phil were
thrown into a nipa shack, where they fell unceremoniously
on top of a sleeping human
being who awakened with a cry of alarm and
fear, striking at them with his manacled hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Lieutenant Tillotson,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed
gladly, as he rolled away to the
farthest side of the small hut, to put himself
out of reach of the startled prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; came from the figure, in
a weak voice. &#8220;Yes, I am Lieutenant Tillotson.
Tell me I&#8217;m not dreaming. Didn&#8217;t I
hear a white man&#8217;s voice?&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_288.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>UP THE FACE OF THE<br />
CLIFF</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>Phil could see him dimly by the light of
the camp-fire outside. The man had been
completely cowed. What terrible torture had
been inflicted to cause him to become such an
abject figure, groveling before them, his voice
hollow, and in his eyes a light of unreasonable
fear?</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Midshipman Perry and O&#8217;Neil from
the gunboat, Tillotson,&#8221; the lad whispered.
&#8220;We hope to save you if you will keep quiet
and do just what we tell you.&#8221; Phil could
have wept in pity at the sight of the physical
wreck before him. He was shocked at the
sight. Tillotson&#8217;s eyes were dull and the face
empty of hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you are saying,&#8221;
he answered in a monotonous voice. &#8220;No
one can be saved who is brought to this
place. Death is the one avenue of escape.
Oh! No one knows of the tortures I have
endured from that fiend&#8217;s hands.&#8221; Then his
face lit up for a second as he raised himself
from the ground and stared at Phil, who had
approached and stood looking down pityingly
upon him. &#8220;How can you save me? Oh, tell
me the truth. Are you not prisoners also?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>Phil seated himself by the side of the unnerved
man and begged him to be calm and
reserve his strength. After a few moments
he told him of the plan and his hopes for
success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us pray for success,&#8221; the captive cried
weakly. &#8220;I had determined to throw myself
off the cliff rather than undergo another day&#8217;s
torture.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tillotson talked for an hour, gruesomely
dwelling on the details of his horrible treatment
by Espinosa. He told of his mission to
the spy, with the letter which Phil had taken
from the dead messenger at Binalbagan. The
message was in Espinosa&#8217;s own handwriting,
and warned the attackers of the gunboat&#8217;s
approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see now that I have been repaid for my
stupidity,&#8221; he moaned. &#8220;I believed that I
could unmask him and earn the thanks of the
general, but first I wished to get from him a
full confession and implicate his accomplices.
I showed him the letter and told him I would
call at his house after visiting the sentries.&#8221;
The overwrought officer broke down and
sobbed for several minutes before continuing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
&#8220;I was a child in his hands; I did not know
his power. His followers trapped me and carried
me away by water, bringing me to this
awful place. Every day some new torture is
devised for me. To-day I was suspended by
my neck with only my toes on the ground.
That was the worst so far. I don&#8217;t know what
it will be to-morrow,&#8221; he ended with a
shudder.</p>

<p>Phil tried to console him as best he could,
but a great fear had entered his thoughts. If
this terrible punishment had been meted out
to Tillotson, what would the treacherous and
cruel Espinosa devise for him? Surely something
many, many times more horrible.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>A RIVER EXPEDITION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Phil and his party had gone on their
hazardous mission, Sydney went aboard the
gunboat to make ready for the work which
had been left in his hands. He felt it keenly
that he could not share this dangerous expedition,
but there was some consolation in the
knowledge that O&#8217;Neil was with Phil.</p>

<p>Another detachment, footsore and tired from
its forced march from a distant post, had arrived
at the ranch, and the two staff officers
were untiringly arranging all the details for
the attack in force.</p>

<p>Sydney, upon his arrival on the gunboat,
gave orders that all obstructions be cleared
away from the guns, and directed the placing
of iron sheeting to protect the officers and men
who would be, with him, exposed on the gunboat&#8217;s
bridge.</p>

<p>The plan of attack was to divide the force
of soldiers; the gunboat to carry as many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
the men as her limited deck space would accommodate,
and the remainder were to go by
trail, guided by Garcia. A sufficient force
would remain to guard the ranch, to which
point supplies were on their way up the river
from Palilo.</p>

<p>General Wilson would command the expedition
in person from on board the gunboat.</p>

<p>At sunrise Sydney was awake, and already
the camp ashore was alive and the lad saw
the companies drawn up, their rifles stacked,
eating their morning meal. Hurriedly dressing
he was rowed ashore, but before leaving
he had ordered all his boats to be lowered for
transporting the soldiers to the gunboat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Lukban, one of Rodriguez&#8217;s officers,
will go with you as a guide,&#8221; Captain Blynn
informed the lad as he stepped ashore. &#8220;He
was wounded in the attack on the ranch, but
he is well enough to go on the gunboat, and
he knows the navigation of the river. He is
now questioning an insurgent officer who was
brought in by one of our companies; they
captured him in a village several miles from
here.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lukban is like a wild beast; they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
just told him of Rodriguez&#8217;s murder by Espinosa
and Salas, so I suppose we had best keep
an eye on this unfortunate prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn led Sydney down to the
basement of the ranch house. The midshipman,
when his eyes became accustomed to the
gloom, gave an exclamation of surprised horror
as he saw a half-strangled native on the
floor with several others astride his heaving
chest. Sydney noticed the wounded major
in a chair, looking down upon his victim, a
savage smile on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not strictly orthodox,&#8221; Captain Blynn
whispered as he saw the horror in Sydney&#8217;s
eyes, &#8220;but it&#8217;s effective.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little more,&#8221; Major Lukban ordered in
a cold voice, after nodding a welcome to the
newcomers.</p>

<p>Sydney saw the native at the prisoner&#8217;s
head slowly pour the water which he held in
a bamboo cup between the prisoner&#8217;s teeth.
The unfortunate man choked, while the veins
in his neck stood out like whip-cords. His
eyes turned glassy and staring, while his colorless
face became a sickly blue.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll kill him,&#8221; Sydney cried aghast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be allowed, captain,&#8221; he appealed,
turning to the army man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry, Monroe,&#8221; the captain
answered calmly, &#8220;he knows within a few
drops of how much the man can stand&mdash;watch!&#8221;
he added quietly, as the natives
raised the prone captive to a sitting position
and struck him smartly on the back with
their open hands. The native coughed and
sputtered; gradually his color returned and
he drew great gasping breaths.</p>

<p>After the prisoner had returned to a comparatively
normal condition, the inquisitor
reached out his hand and struck him smartly
across the cheek. Where his hand had fallen,
a white imprint was left, dying out gradually,
as the sluggish blood flowed back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the &#8216;water cure,&#8217;&#8221; Captain Blynn
observed as Major Lukban fired question after
question at the thoroughly cowed and now
tractable prisoner. &#8220;He will exact a confession
from him which will give us all the information
we need. If you or I did this we
would be court-martialed and maybe dismissed
but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He ended with an expressive
shrug.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>Sydney turned sick at the sight of a human
being tortured beyond endurance and a fear
rose in his mind as he thought of poor Phil in
Espinosa&#8217;s hands. As he watched, the native
appeared to hesitate in answering a question,
but a wave of Lukban&#8217;s hand, bringing the
attending natives and the water cup nearer,
caused him to answer the question immediately.
Once the native refused to answer and
then despite his cries of fear and struggles almost
superhuman, he was forced back upon his
back, and his jaws pried rudely open with a
stick, while the bamboo cup was poised menacingly
above his open mouth.</p>

<p>The next moment the cup was sent spinning
from the native&#8217;s hand and Sydney had
jerked the captive to his feet, and stood flushed
with anger and excitement between him and
his torturer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t stand by and see any more of this
torture,&#8221; he exclaimed forcefully. &#8220;It&#8217;s a disgrace
for us to allow it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn shrugged his shoulders,
while Lukban glared angrily at the indignant
champion.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, se&ntilde;or, I must have that question answered,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
he declared. &#8220;It will not injure
him, and it may save us many lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the question?&#8221; Captain Blynn
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether there is a third trail from the
stronghold and how it may be reached,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;You see, captain, if there is we
must guard it, for otherwise all will escape us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Blynn nodded, glancing amusedly
at Sydney&#8217;s excited face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, major, that question must remain
unanswered,&#8221; he said in a level tone,
turning and leading the way out.</p>

<p>Sydney turned the half-drowned prisoner
over to one of Captain Blynn&#8217;s soldiers with
orders to guard him carefully and to allow no
interference by their native allies.</p>

<p>By nine o&#8217;clock two hundred men had been
embarked on the gunboat and five hundred
more had started under the command of Captain
Blynn along the trail leading up the
river; Garcia as leader was at their head.</p>

<p>In the party on the gunboat were General
Wilson, Major Marble and Major Lukban; the
latter, still sullen and angry with Sydney for
his unwarranted presumption in making him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
discontinue his torture, stood with his former
victim on the bridge of the &#8220;Mindinao.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney headed the vessel into the narrow
channel, cautiously picking his way through
the numerous shoals; one minute the gunboat
clung closely to the steep river bank on
one side and the next it was scraping the overhanging
trees on the other side.</p>

<p>From the masthead the lookout kept the
soldiers on shore in sight, and Sydney regulated
his speed to just keep pace with them.
He thought often and with grave concern of
Phil. What luck had he had? His heartbeats
quickened as he vaguely wondered if he
were alive! He realized the terrible cruelty
of the Filipino leader, and Espinosa had reason
to hate the young naval man!</p>

<p>The small house, where the midshipmen
had unexpectedly met Colonel Salas, flashed
into view as they rounded a bend in the river,
and from the bridge Sydney could discern
with his glasses far in the distance the
enemy&#8217;s stronghold, Matiginao, &#8220;the impregnable.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the gunboat swept slowly by close inshore
the soldiers waved their campaign hats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
in silent salute to their formidable navy
ally.</p>

<p>&#8220;This, from here on, is unknown river,
sir,&#8221; Sydney reported to the general, sitting
calmly talking with his adjutant-general.</p>

<p>The general nodded and answered with a
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, admiral, I am entirely satisfied
to rely upon your judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Lukban had during the gunboat&#8217;s
progress up the river stood by Sydney&#8217;s side,
showing his appreciation of the lad&#8217;s navigation
at intervals by a silent nod, while at
the same time he kept one guarding eye upon
his captive, whose crafty, sullen eyes roved incessantly
along the wooded slopes of the narrowing river.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not new to you then, major?&#8221; Sydney
asked suddenly, as he directed the ship&#8217;s
head toward a large dead tree which stood
out a lone sentinel on a rocky point ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a boy I was brought up on this river,&#8221;
the native replied sadly. &#8220;Then many thousand
of my people lived in plenty and happiness
along its banks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have they all gone?&#8221; the lad inquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
interestedly, his eyes gazing about for
the signs of a deserted population.</p>

<p>Lukban pointed to the tall mountains
ahead of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time and again the Spaniards have endeavored
to drive out the outlaws from yonder
stronghold, and the poor people who
made their living on the river were mercilessly
preyed upon by the war parties of the
contending factions, until none were left.
Juan Rodriguez alone has managed to remain,
but only by his fearless courage and the devotion
of his followers. Neither side cared to
provoke him in his security until Espinosa
coveted his lands and his money and, who
can say, maybe his beautiful daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maria!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.</p>

<p>The native lowered his voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Espinosa has had but one ambition all his
life; to marry the daughter of Rodriguez; but
she scorned him, and to save her from his
persistent attention, Se&ntilde;orita Maria was sent
away to Manila to school. Now he has robbed
her of her father and stolen the treasure which
had been hoarded for her. For many years
Espinosa has been the head of the outlaws of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
Kapay. Holding positions of trust under
Spanish rule, he directed the rebel movements
and prevented their annihilation by the Spanish
columns. This identical work he has attempted
under the American rule, but his
treachery has at last been exposed. Until he
openly threatened the life of Rodriguez, none
of us dared to thwart him. His murderers
are everywhere, and his society of the Katipunan
is far-reaching. Nowhere in the archipelago
is one safe from their vengeance.
Maria, woman as she is, has been marked for
the assassin&#8217;s knife if she continues to refuse
to become the wife of its leader. Garcia,
Rodriguez&#8217;s trusted friend and overseer, was
lured by terrible threats of vengeance and
hopes of reward to betray his benefactor. He
had been chosen by the society to commit the
repulsive crime of murdering his friend. He
came to the Rodriguez house intending to kill
the father and carry away the daughter into
captivity, which would have been for her a
living death. Through the administering of
the water and the voluntary confessions of
Garcia, I have found out every motive which
has actuated both Espinosa and Garcia. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
would-be murderer entered the room of his
victim, but in the light of the lamp could not
bring himself to murder his lifelong friend.
He at least had remaining some of the kindlier
feelings in his heart. Turning out the
light he was about to despatch him with a
swift dagger thrust as he lay innocently sleeping;
then hearing a noise on the stairs he
withdrew into the darkness of an adjoining
room. It was Se&ntilde;orita Maria and the two
Americans who had remained to protect her.
Seeing that to stay would mean discovery, he
escaped by a window, intending to meet Espinosa
and his men as they stole through the
uproar of the bolo attack and tell him of the
locality of the treasure. Espinosa is a leader
of no mean order. His attack on the ranch
was masterfully executed. Even though
wounded, he came unhindered through the
thick of the attack, with his body-guard of
twenty faithful men. These were the ones
who entered the house and carried away the
treasure chests.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Garcia, escaping, reached the
ground, your trusty boatswain&#8217;s mate, O&#8217;Neil,
was on the spot.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>Major Lukban&#8217;s eyes were on his restive
captive as he talked in low tones to Sydney.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must keep an eye on him,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;He has given me so much information that he
would be killed if he fell into
Espinosa&#8217;s hands. Knowing the danger he
runs, acting as our guide, he may attempt to
escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; was now where the dapper
little colonel had taken his involuntary
bath. The river had become sensibly narrower
and the shores more treacherously rocky.</p>

<p>The captive suddenly turned and excitedly
spoke to Major Lukban in the native language,
his gaze meanwhile roving over the
cliffs just visible ahead.</p>

<p>Lukban gave Sydney the man&#8217;s words in
Spanish:</p>

<p>&#8220;He says the gunboat can pass through the
ca&ntilde;on, but you must keep close to the left
hand shore to avoid the huge rocks which the
insurgents will hurl from the top of the
stronghold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney&#8217;s heart beat faster. They had not
as yet come in sight of the whirling maelstrom
of water as it hurled itself through the narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
gorge, but the top of the ca&ntilde;on was in plain
sight. One huge boulder dislodged from the
heights, striking the deck of the &#8220;Mindinao,&#8221;
could easily pierce her frail steel shell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you go through on the gunboat,
sir?&#8221; Sydney asked the general eagerly as the
&#8220;Mindinao&#8221; rounded a bend in the river, and
the muddy racing water loomed ahead straight
as if nature had laid a ruler along its path.
About a mile away the other end of the ca&ntilde;on
appeared, a white streak of light between the
sombre rocks.</p>

<p>The general regarded him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you expect me to go?&#8221; he
asked, a twinkle appearing in his eyes for a
fraction of a second.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of the danger, sir,&#8221; the lad
added hurriedly in apology. &#8220;They&#8217;ll probably
throw rocks down on us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The commanding general cannot always
be three miles in the rear,&#8221; the veteran replied,
now smiling broadly.</p>

<p>Sydney had sent word to the engine room
that he desired all speed possible and despite
the current against them, the wooded shores
were passed quickly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>&#8220;To your guns,&#8221; he called in a clear voice
without a note of excitement. &#8220;Major,&#8221; he
added turning to the adjutant-general, &#8220;some
of your best shots might take station to
pick off the enemy on the cliffs. Those on
this end I hope will be Phil and his friendly
natives.&#8221; He turned suddenly pale as the
possibility occurred to him of shelling his own
people.</p>

<p>The gunboat sped swiftly toward the ca&ntilde;on.
Through glasses the jagged rocks at the top
could be seen covered with a curious crowd of
natives. Several sharp reports came muffled
to his ears. The soft coo of the alarm concha
vibrated above the stillness. He called his
three gun-pointers up on the bridge and cautioned
them with painstaking care of their
important duty. &#8220;Shoot at the middle and
the left; Captain Perry is on that mountain
and I hope at this end. All three will fire together
and I will control from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men listened gravely and returned to
their guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Load,&#8221; Sydney ordered harshly. The
breech-blocks clicked shut and the crew stood
expectantly alert. The soldiers, unaccustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
to artillery, unconsciously edged away from
the three bow guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Set your sights at 1,500 yards,&#8221; Sydney
directed, at the same time giving a signal to
the helmsman to hold the ship steady on her
course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire when you&#8217;re on, aim at the edge of the
rock,&#8221; he said in a tense voice.</p>

<p>The three guns roared almost in unison and
three black dots winged swiftly out toward
the frowning cliffs ahead of the gunboat.
Three dull brown splashes suddenly appeared
just under the edge of the cliff and the reverberations
died out slowly to an unearthly
wail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seventeen hundred,&#8221; the lad cried out
sharply, for the shots had fallen short of the
mark.</p>

<p>The sight-setters corrected their sights by a
swift movement of the wheel under their
hand and the air was again rent by the discharges.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine shots,&#8221; the general exclaimed excitedly
as he leveled his glass at the top of the
mountain where the three shells had exploded,
scattering the rock and dirt in all directions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
and causing the inquisitive insurgents to hurriedly
seek shelter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rapid fire,&#8221; Sydney ordered calmly and
his voice had scarcely died away when a puff of
white smoke belched from the stronghold.</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s heart almost stopped beating.
Artillery he did not fear, if he could return
the fire. He was confident that he could take
care of himself with those three unerring
guns, but this gun of the enemy was mounted
just where Phil had warned him not to shoot.
He sickened at the thought of disobeying the
order, yet there was the menacing screech of
the shell in his ears, as it struck the water
only a few hundred yards ahead of his approaching
gunboat.</p>

<p>What else could he do? The gun must be
silenced before the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; could proceed,
and the gorge was only a thousand yards
ahead.</p>

<small>A WILLING CAPTIVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun was high the next morning before
Phil awakened from his sound sleep. He had
tossed on his hard bed listening to the half
morbid ravings of poor Tillotson. Ever before
him was the fear that after all he would
be unable to save him. He knew only too
well the difficulties that must be overcome before
a rescue were possible. He recalled the
difficult trails over which he and O&#8217;Neil had
been led. At every point they had been under
the eyes of unseen men on top of the
mountain and within the range of modern
rifles. There was not a tree nor rock large
enough to offer cover to the men who on the
morrow would assault the stronghold. His
heart ever beat faster as he pictured the fight
in his imagination: The natives behind intrenchments,
cornered, no retreat open to
them, fighting with the courage of despair;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
and the American soldiers, fearlessly charging
upward, giving no heed to the danger at the
top. On the summit, the lad knew, it would
be a fight to the death. The part he was to
play had seemed only too simple in the light
of day, but now in the silence of the night,
bound as he was hand and foot, and guarded
by cruel enemies who would gladly shoot him
down at the first show of force, all seemed
different. O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s healthy body had long
since been wrapped in slumber and when
Phil&#8217;s feverish eyes opened he was up and
seated calmly by the lad&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are over a thousand of these gugus
here in the camp,&#8221; he exclaimed as Phil with
difficulty arose and endeavored to stretch his
cramped limbs. &#8220;I have been spying from
the door there, and I see Lopez has encamped
his men right at the top of the trail, and the
men who were there have been sent somewhere
else. The natives who are guarding us
are our own men, and one of &#8217;em tried to stick
his bayonet in me when I asked him for some
water to wash in. I wish they were not so
careful of appearances,&#8221; he added with a grim
smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>This was certainly cheering news. Lopez
then had won his first point with the insurgent
leader. Espinosa had believed his story.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tillotson still lay like a log,
completely overcome from exhaustion, caused
by his torture of yesterday. Phil looked with
compassion on the weak, boyish face; he was
breathing evenly, but his skin was of an unhealthy
pallor.</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks ill, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil declared as Phil
turned away with a sigh. &#8220;A few more days
will do for him. He&#8217;s got too sensitive a nature
for soldiering.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doorway was darkened by the entrance
of two natives. Phil regarded them coldly as
they advanced, and led him not ungently by
the arm out into the sunshine. There they
cut his binding cords and gave both him and
O&#8217;Neil a bucket of water to wash in. They
had been on the point of arousing Tillotson
by a cruel kick, but through Phil&#8217;s insistence,
they left the shack without disturbing the
sleeping man.</p>

<p>After eating and enjoying a scanty breakfast,
the two Americans surveyed with great
interest the scenes about them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>&#8220;Do you see that gun there, sir?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed,
suddenly nodding his head toward a
Spanish howitzer mounted on the cliff just
to the right of the trail. &#8220;It&#8217;s manned by
Espinosa&#8217;s men!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad,&#8221; Phil replied anxiously; &#8220;and
you notice, it commands the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; in Spanish from behind
them caused Phil to swing about quickly and
gaze into the amused but wicked eyes of
Colonel Salas. &#8220;So we are to have the pleasure
of your company as our guest, after all?&#8221;
the Filipino continued tauntingly. &#8220;General
Espinosa is making great preparations for
your reception. It is needless for me to tell
you how delighted he is that you have
changed your mind. He was very angry at
me for not insisting on your coming with me
the other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil regarded the little native, a fine scorn
in his eyes. He would have liked nothing
better than to have answered him in the same
ironical vein, but he realized that to do so and
anger him would only make more difficult
their position.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be here to pay his respects shortly,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
Salas continued ironically. &#8220;Ah! here he
comes now.&#8221;</p>

<p>With his heart beating fast and the muscles
in his throat tightening, Phil saw Espinosa
sauntering toward them. He was dressed in
the uniform of a Filipino general, made in the
Spanish fashion, of a mouse-colored duck with
a rolling collar, on which a silver star glistened.
He came slowly forward, a wicked
smile on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;or Perry! So! I have you now in my
power?&#8221; he said in a low, hard voice. &#8220;I
knew that my time would come. Your cleverness
caused me some inconvenience. Colonel
Martinez is still to be accounted for.
But&#8221;&mdash;and he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;&#8220;that
is but a matter of days. You can see that I
am now master of the situation. I shall annihilate
your untried, inefficient volunteers with
as much ease as I can kill flies on the wall of
a butcher shop. Your general dare not call
in his men from the garrisons in the north.
After I have worn out and killed those sent
against me, then I shall attack Palilo itself.
Then when I have the city in my hands and
your general has withdrawn or surrenders, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
shall wire to Manila my willingness to accept
civil government. I shall go through the
form of surrendering to the vanquished Americans,
and shall be made the governor of Kapay.
I shall then carry on my authority under your
own flag. Is it not a very clever plan? Ah,
there is one point that I have forgotten, a governor
of an island as rich as Kapay must have
a suitable dwelling. Very well. Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez
is no more; his house is vacant and
adequate for the worthy purpose; and the
se&ntilde;orita&mdash;how well the title of wife to the
governor of Kapay would become her!</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see, se&ntilde;or, after all, Espinosa has
lost nothing,&#8221; he ended with mock politeness.</p>

<p>Phil glared angrily at this vain, boastful
Malay half-breed. How dare he even think
of marrying a girl like Maria Rodriguez?
Phil knew that she would rather die first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every man in the American army will
fight you to the last fence,&#8221; Phil exclaimed
savagely. &#8220;Your villainy and treachery are
too well known among even your own people,
who serve you only through fear. You will
never be made a governor under the civil
government. That won&#8217;t aid you to carry out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
your vengeful purposes upon those whom you
might choose to call your enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Espinosa&#8217;s face paled slightly, and his eyes
kindled in anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry that I cannot allow you to remain
alive to see my prophecy come true,&#8221; he
replied with a cruel shrug. &#8220;And before I
am found out, as you Americans say, and displaced,
I shall have enough money put aside
in banks outside of the Philippines to live in
ease and luxury for the remainder of my life.</p>

<p>&#8220;These thoughts,&#8221; he added, &#8220;may cheer
your last hours. It should be a pleasure to
you to know that you haven&#8217;t done me as
much harm as you supposed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil glared at his tormentor, a bitter hatred
in his eyes. How cleverly had this half-breed
played upon the credulity of the Americans!
For months this despicable native had ruled
over both the warring parties; on one hand
controlling the native bands of insurgents,
telling them how, when and where to attack
their enemy and then by his plausible words
and treacherous cunning had exerted sufficient
influence over General Wilson and his
aides to enable him to so dispose the scattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
American troops as to make them impotent,
helpless against the insurgent ambushes and
attacks. The lad noticed with a certain satisfaction
that the native wore his left arm in a
sling. Was that then the effect of his shot
the night of the meeting of the Katipunan
society? How he blamed himself for not
having taken a more careful aim; he remembered
with disappointment that when he had
pulled the trigger of his revolver, his aim had
been to the left of Espinosa&#8217;s body. Phil&#8217;s
gaze was not lost on the half-breed. With a
snarl he glanced down at his almost helpless
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;For this I took Rodriguez&#8217;s life with my
own hands, although Garcia had been chosen
for the deed,&#8221; he exclaimed darkly, &#8220;and for
this I shall force his daughter to become the
wife of Manuel Espinosa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gasped, a flood of angry blood
mounting to his temples.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was I who fired the shot,&#8221; the lad cried
exultantly, &#8220;and the next time you won&#8217;t
get off so easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>Espinosa in sullen rage regarded the angry
midshipman through his slit-like eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>&#8220;You?&#8221; he cried in unfeigned surprise.
&#8220;How did you get there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was there,&#8221; Phil replied quickly, a keen
satisfaction entering his thoughts at being
able to beard the lion in his den, &#8220;and afterward
exposed you to the general&mdash;but,&#8221; he
asked suddenly, &#8220;why did you desert? If
you hadn&#8217;t we would have had a pleasant little
hanging party in the Plaza the next morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Espinosa was evidently enraged at the lad&#8217;s
daring words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are brave,&#8221; he said suddenly, a spark
of suspicion coming into his mind, &#8220;to speak
this way before me knowing that I can have
you hung, or tortured, by simply giving the
order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know your yellow soul too well,&#8221; Phil
declared in answer, &#8220;to believe that anything
I might say now would influence the plan for
revenge which you have already made.
But I am curious to know why you left Palilo
so suddenly. Did you believe that Rodriguez
would betray you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The outlaw glared at the midshipman, his
hands twitching longingly to take forcible
hold on his tormentor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>&#8220;Because of that shot,&#8221; Espinosa answered
finally, &#8220;I feared there might have been an
enemy at the meeting and I feared Captain
Blynn&#8217;s hand,&mdash;I would give a box of old
Rodriguez&#8217;s gold to have him here a prisoner,&#8221;
he added, a flash of terror in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may be here any moment now,&#8221; Phil
said quietly. Then he would have bitten off
his tongue as he saw the sudden gleam of
suspicion in his enemy&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>Espinosa gave the lad a searching look.
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked casting a
glance of fear about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; the lad answered carelessly,
&#8220;only he knows you killed Rodriguez,
stole his money and tried to carry off his
daughter; also by this time he will know that
I&#8217;m a prisoner in your hands. And if for no
other reason, you hold Lieutenant Tillotson,
and his father is overturning the war department
to rescue him. You made a bad fist of
it there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had been watching the native leader&#8217;s
anxious face, as he glanced about him as if
half fearing the big American to appear suddenly
from the ground. He now saw it light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
up with keen enjoyment as his eyes encountered
something which amused him.
Looking up quickly the lad uttered an exclamation
of horror as he realized with overwhelming
force the true position in which he
had placed himself and his trusted boatswain&#8217;s
mate.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil, bound hand and foot, had been
triced up, his toes just resting on the ground,
and his strong bronzed face swollen and blue
from a strangling rope knotted about his
neck, the end thrown over a framework apparently
built for this diabolical torture.</p>

<p>Phil turned his face away. He saw as
through a red mist the throngs of curious
natives who had quickly gathered to see their
enemy slowly murdered before their eyes.</p>

<p>Espinosa gave a guttural order and immediately
Phil was seized and forced to gaze at
the revolting torture of his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not kill him yet,&#8221; Espinosa
said, while he smiled in keen delight at the
discomfited midshipman. &#8220;I have promised
my men a field day. We have many
amusing ways of treating our guests,&mdash;but,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;before your turn comes I wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
some information which I know you can
give.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is General Wilson?&#8221; he asked
anxiously, &#8220;and is it true that your gunboat is
in the river?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are your scouts?&#8221; Phil exclaimed
haughtily. &#8220;Ask them, not your prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I choose to ask my prisoner,&#8221; the native
retorted with a meaning glance at those who
held Phil&#8217;s head turned so that he must see
out of the tail of his eyes the cruel suffering
of O&#8217;Neil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your prisoner does not choose to answer,&#8221;
the lad declared stoutly.</p>

<p>The next second Phil was jerked suddenly
upon his back, and his hands and feet hauled
out, spread eagle fashion to stakes driven
in the solid ground. He was quite helpless,
and the pain in his arms and legs was excruciating.
He opened his mouth to cry out
when quickly a wedge of hard wood was inserted,
holding his jaws wide apart.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and stiffened his muscle
in a supreme endeavor to withstand the pain
and prevent himself showing his suffering to
the delighted natives.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>&#8220;Now maybe you will consider your answer&mdash;Colonel
Salas, a little water may loosen his
tongue,&#8221; he heard the cruel voice of Espinosa
say.</p>

<p>A horrible fear overcame the lad. The
water cure was to be given him. He was to
be half drowned. To be made to feel all the
torturing sensations of a drowning man; not
once but many times, until his spirit was
broken and he would answer questions which
would make him traitorously injure his own
cause. His eyes opened, and he saw dimly
Espinosa&#8217;s mocking face above him. The
sun had flamed forth from under a cloud and
burned down unmercifully on his staring
eyes. He noted vaguely that it had passed
the meridian. Then a terrible fear came into
his mind. Where were the gunboat and the
soldiers? Surely by this time they would have
made their presence known. Had the gunboat
run aground and the expedition been delayed?
Would a delay mean death to him and O&#8217;Neil
or only one more awful day of diabolical torture?</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will cease torturing my man,&#8221; Phil
said with difficulty through his wedged jaws,
&#8220;I will answer your questions.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>Espinosa laughed cruelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you would dictate your own terms,&#8221; he
cackled. &#8220;Colonel Salas, just a few cupfuls.
Captain Perry seems thirsty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil swallowed the water as it was poured
down his throat, holding his breath long intervals
at a time. It seemed to him that the
water was never ending; he had swallowed
quarts and yet he drank. Finally he could
swallow no longer and yet the cruel hand
above him poured the liquid without ceasing
into his wide open mouth. The water
splashed and ran out. He managed yet to
breathe by contracting the muscles of his
throat and then taking a slow breath but
even then he felt the irritation of a few drops
of water in his lungs and he knew if he
coughed, as he must in a second, that all the
water in his throat and mouth would enter
his windpipe and fairly choke him. A feeling
of suffocation oppressed him, as if a heavy
weight lay pressing on his chest. He knew
as yet he had not suffered, that this was but a
taste of what was to come. Once more, this
time as if from a great distance, he heard the
cold, sinister voice of the half-breed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>&#8220;Before it is too late,&#8221; he said, &#8220;will you
answer my questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil opened his eyes and gazed at his tormentors.
Then he closed them and steeled
himself to what was to come.</p>

<p>He felt his nose held securely by muscular
fingers and his head thrown back, making a
reservoir of his mouth, which was kept full
of water.</p>

<p>Just before he closed his eyes Phil had
taken a full breath and now with his lungs
full of air he knew that the agony was less
than two minutes away. Strong swimmer as
he was, he knew that was the limit of his endurance,
and then afterward would come the
sickening sensation of water agonizingly
breathed into his lungs. Congestion would
follow and if there was any trouble with his
heart it would stop. If not, the cruel Colonel
Salas who, with a delighted smile, was pouring
the water, would stop and free the lad&#8217;s
mouth of water, permitting him to regain his
breath, working over him as if he were a
half-drowned man, and after he had been
brought to by artificial respiration, the
cruel torture would be begun again and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
carried out until he agreed to do his enemy&#8217;s
bidding.</p>

<p>Those two minutes were the longest in the
lad&#8217;s life. His entire past flashed before his
eyes and he shed tears of disappointment at
the thought that this might be his death. He
wondered how much time had passed. Then
he began to count the seconds, but soon
stopped in horror; it was too much like self-destruction.
He held his breath now tightly,
allowing just a little air at a time to escape
through his throat. He opened his eyes once
or twice, but he could see nothing but a fiery
sun overhead. He had the sensation that his
entire body was swelling. Every vein seemed
to have hardened. The sweat poured from
his forehead, stinging his eyes.</p>

<p>He could hold his breath no longer. His
blood throbbed painfully in his temples. An
awful nausea overcame him, and he gasped
for air.</p>

<p>Then a sharp sound as of the discharge of
a cannon sounded in his ears and he fought
and struggled with the strength of a score of
men for the precious air.</p>

<small>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE STRONGHOLD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Phil and O&#8217;Neil were being tortured
by Espinosa, Lopez had kept watch from his
station, guarding the trail leading up the
precipitous mountain from the valley below.
His eyes fascinatedly held upon the scene in
front of him had nevertheless guardedly
turned backward, scanning anxiously the
wooded foothills below him and the vista of
the river as it entered the ca&ntilde;on. As yet no
signs of the rescuers were visible. He trembled
when he saw that Espinosa had determined
to give the midshipman the water torture.
But few white men had survived its harshness.
Lopez&#8217;s face wore an increasingly
anxious look as the minutes dragged into
hours. The sun had passed the meridian and
was dipping slowly in the western sky. His
own men had not left their posts; each understood
his duty; Rodriguez&#8217;s faithful followers
alone had been selected to guard this southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
bastion of the stronghold. The faithful native
could see a handful of Espinosa&#8217;s men at the
howitzer mounted to command the approach
by water and farther along the edge of the
precipice small knots of men squatting under
shelters of bamboo. These latter he knew
were to dislodge great boulders, which had
been delicately balanced ready to be thrown
downward, five hundred or more feet, into the
racing river. Those who dared to enter the
treacherous waters of the ca&ntilde;on must run the
gauntlet of these huge rocks, but Lopez knew
that the Americans would take any risk to
reach the trail leading away from the stronghold
and further into the mountain fastness,
over which the trapped insurgents would endeavor
to escape.</p>

<p>Several hundred natives, their weapons in
hand, had gathered about their cruel leader.
Every eye was turned in rapt enjoyment toward
the delighting spectacle of the torture
of a despised American. None save Lopez
and his faithful guards had observed the glint
of steel far down in the valley below. None
save he discerned two small white poles creeping
along above the high trees on the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
bank. He glanced uneasily toward the torture.
Phil was on his back securely bound,
while Colonel Salas held above his head a
long bamboo cane filled with water.</p>

<p>Lopez whispered an order to a native sergeant
and the latter noiselessly edged his way
in the direction of the sailor, now apparently
senseless, deserted by those who had been torturing
him, now that they were being indulged
in a more interesting spectacle.</p>

<p>Lopez, his heart beating and his bronze
face set determinedly, watched the two topmasts
of the gunboat as they traveled toward
the bend in the river. The next second the
&#8220;Mindinao&#8217;s&#8221; white bow came slowly, majestically
from behind the land and turned gracefully
up the river toward the ca&ntilde;on. At
the foot of the trail khaki-clad figures suddenly
appeared and mounted slowly up the
narrow path. He could see the guides in
front clearing and uncovering the treacherous
man traps. His men had now seen the
approaching deliverers and their black eyes
snapped excitedly. Any one with half an
eye would have known that something out of
the ordinary was going forward. The eager<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
brown soldiers of Rodriguez moved about
restlessly, glancing excitedly down into the
valley below them. Fortunately the leader
and his followers were too absorbed in watching
the suffering of poor Phil to take heed of
the strange behavior of the deserters from
Rodriguez.</p>

<p>Lopez saw the little gunboat stop suddenly
in the river and he observed plainly groups
of men at the bow guns. Then came a flash
of flame from her white hull and a reverberation
which shook the mountain stronghold to
its foundation.</p>

<p>The tortured and half-dead Americans were
forgotten; their captors had rushed away to see
the meaning of this interruption. It was but
the work of an instant for the watchful Lopez
to sever with a few swift strokes of his bolo
the cords that bound his white chief. O&#8217;Neil
was likewise cut down, and the two nearly
lifeless men were dragged to the safety of that
part of the stronghold guarded by Lopez and
his small band.</p>

<p>Shell after shell came speeding up from the
gunboat, and meanwhile the khaki-clad soldiers,
unobserved, toiled onward up the slope.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>&#8220;To your posts,&#8221; Espinosa cried out in
alarm. &#8220;Open fire with that gun.&#8221; The surprised
and terrified leader raved like a madman,
taking all to task for their stupidity.
Phil had been released so promptly, while all
was uproar and confusion, that as yet the insurgents
had not realized that Lopez and his
men were against them. Espinosa, in a fever
of excitement, himself ran to the howitzer
and with his own hands pointed and fired the
first shot. But that was the last shot the gun
would ever fire, for Lopez with a number of
his men pushed quietly forward, cutting its
binding ropes and shoved it over the edge of
the cliff from which it crashed downward to
the river below.</p>

<p>Espinosa turned aghast and met the cold,
defiant eye of Lopez. In them he read his
doom. Lopez&#8217;s sharp bolo was already circling
about his head. But the next second it had
flashed harmlessly by and rattled on the
rocky ground. Fearful of his life Espinosa
had dodged the blow aimed at him and had
taken flight, screaming as he ran for his men
to open fire on the traitors. The shells of the
gunboat seemed to fall in every part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
stronghold and the havoc of their explosions
was terrible to witness; but the small band
under Lopez remained unharmed.</p>

<p>Mad with fear, the natives who had been
witnessing Phil&#8217;s torture, upon hearing the
terrifying words of their leader and seeing the
awful havoc behind them caused by the
bursting shell, charged boldly on the natives
in their front, believing that in that direction
lay their one avenue of escape, but a well directed
volley from Lopez&#8217;s men made them
recoil in disorder.</p>

<p>Like one who is chained, powerless in the
grip of an unnerving nightmare, Phil felt
rather than saw the wild scenes about him.
He heard the sharp rattle of musket fire and
the sonorous discharge of cannon, the wild,
vibrant cries of the natives as they dashed
now forward and again retreating from the
clash of contact and the avenging strokes of
bayonet and bolo. By a mighty effort he
struggled to his feet and leaned heavily for
support upon the bamboo frame of his prison.
His lungs seemed on fire and a red mist was
still in his eyes. The riot of forms about him
confused his brain and made him dizzy. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
his eyes fell upon the body of O&#8217;Neil lying on
the ground where the natives had dragged
him; the cruel marks of the rope stood out in
blue welts on his muscular neck. His eyes
were closed, but the lad saw with joy that he
was alive. He knelt by the sailor&#8217;s side ministering
to him as tenderly as if he were a
child. Then in great anxiety he saw that
Lopez&#8217;s men were slowly giving ground.
Stubbornly they fought, but the overwhelming
ranks of the enemy, now alive to the
actual conditions and spurred forward by
their leaders, came frantically forward across
the open ground.</p>

<p>Phil dragged the senseless body of the sailor
back until they were on the very edge of the
hill and then a sight which made him mad
with joy caused him to stand upright and
swing his hat jubilantly, unheeding the leaden
missiles on all sides. There scarcely a hundred
yards below him struggling forward and
upward was Captain Blynn and his five hundred
soldiers. Dropping the sailor&#8217;s head he
rushed madly into the company of loyal natives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charge them,&#8221; he cried, beside himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
with eagerness, for he saw that if the enemy,
one thousand strong, should obtain possession
of the top of the trail the struggling men below
would never reach the top alive, and their
retreat could mean but one thing&mdash;a rout and
massacre.</p>

<p>The natives did not understand the lad&#8217;s
words, but his meaning was only too plain as
he snatched a rifle from the ground and led
the remnant of that plucky band.</p>

<p>The next moment he was in the midst of
the shrieking horde. In his nostrils was the
reek of the Malay, almost sickening in its
overpowering pungency. Blow after blow at
his body he warded off with the barrel of his
rifle.</p>

<p>Now the savage horde had given way and
his men had quickly closed in, warily protecting
their flanks, knowing full well the cunning
of their enemy. To his left the lad saw
hundreds of natives hurling rocks into the
river below them, and he cut a lane toward
them, yelling to the loyal natives to prevent
what he feared would be the destruction of
his ship. From below the ominous rattle of
a Colt gun gladdened his heart and he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
with delight the men on the cliffs flee in terror,
leaving great boulders balanced menacingly
on the very edge of the abyss. An
American cheer rang out from behind him
and he became dizzy with joy at the good
news it brought. He read in the natives&#8217; eyes
a look of terror at the sudden appearance of
an unlooked for enemy, and at the same instant
he realized that if he and his loyal natives
were to be saved he must extricate them
from this dangerous position between the fire
of the two opposing forces. He looked wildly
about him for Lopez, but he was nowhere in
sight, and already the soldiers had begun to
open a withering fire in their direction. Mad
with their exertions, brought suddenly face to
face with the enemy, the soldiers would have
no discretion; friend and foe alike were mixed
in one writhing mass of brown.</p>

<p>Then a sinister face showed itself on his
right hand and all thoughts of safety were
thrown to the winds. Espinosa, the tyrant
and murderer, was within his reach. With a
score of men as a body-guard he was hurrying
away, deserting the field of battle. The midshipman
pressed against the enemy to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
right, fighting his way even through the remnant
of the loyal natives, crying out to them
to follow, while behind him he could hear the
heavy footfalls of the soldiers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_333.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>HE GAZED DOWN INTO THE<br />
STILL FACE</i></p>

<p>A body brushed him nearly off his feet and
he turned toward it, his rifle raised as if to
ward off an expected blow and then as his
eyes fell upon the disheveled figure, he gave a
cry of delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; he shouted above the noise of the
fighting, as he put his arm about the great
figure to steady himself from the force of the
impact from the khaki-clad soldiers pressing
eagerly upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s that devil,&#8221; the sailor cried in
smothered rage, and Phil saw with astonishment
that O&#8217;Neil had naught but his bare
hands though the lust of battle was in his eyes.
The horror of his recent torture pressed
heavily on his mind and he was bending every
exertion to reach the retreating insurgent
leader.</p>

<p>So closely did the Americans press their
foes that the lifeless body of Lieutenant Tillotson
was abandoned, and Phil stopped, kneeling
at his side and gazed down into the still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
face. There was a deep wound in the neck.
Phil saw that the troubled spirit had been released.
Ahead the pursuers had stopped and
were firing fiercely in the direction of the retreating
enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t allow Espinosa to escape,&#8221; the
lad cried, aghast as he regained his men and
saw with horror that many lay moaning on
the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re intrenched there, sir,&#8221; a sergeant
exclaimed. &#8220;It would be suicide to charge
them;&#8221; but Phil had gone too far and had
suffered too much to be stopped by any
thoughts of discretion or danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charge, I say,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;that murderer
Espinosa must not escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant from his security on the
ground gazed up at the lad, believing quite
properly that he had lost his mind, but before
he could be stopped, Phil was beyond reach,
charging blindly forward, while from the intrenchments
came a volume of fire which it
seemed folly to face.</p>

<p>The seasoned old sergeant shook his head
knowingly, but when an officer orders a charge
there is but one thing to do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>As one man the line arose from its shelter
and raced madly after the midshipman.</p>

<p>Hand to hand they battled&mdash;the natives with
a courage born of desperation, for their backs
were almost at the sheer edge of a precipice.
Slowly they gave way before the onslaught of
the Americans.</p>

<p>Phil and O&#8217;Neil fought shoulder to shoulder
and the lad in his weakened condition, bleeding
profusely from a score of wounds, never
more sorely needed the help that the brave
sailorman could give.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting away,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cried out in an
agonized voice as the stubborn defenders fell
one by one before the avenging bayonets.</p>

<p>The natives died bravely, in fanatical fervor,
fighting to the last man, not wishing nor asking
for quarter. O&#8217;Neil and Phil at last
stood upon the brink of a yawning chasm
while they saw, far below them, and just disappearing
within the shadow of the woods, a
small band of natives, while there dangled
from the rocks at their feet the severed end of
a rope&mdash;the leader&#8217;s road to safety.</p>

<small>THE GUNBOAT TAKES A HAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney</span> gazed in consternation at the black
speck clinging to the top of the cliff. His
hands trembled excitedly as he held his glasses
to his eyes focusing upon this spiteful piece of
artillery.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to silence that gun,&#8221; he said in
a hoarse voice to Major Marble at his side, as
he rang the engine room telegraphs for full
speed astern. &#8220;They can&#8217;t miss us, and one
shell would sink us. Yet Phil and O&#8217;Neil are
probably there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are our men, general,&#8221; Major Marble
reported, pointing to a creeping point of color
just emerging from the jungle and showing
itself against the neutral tints of the treeless
mountainside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make up your mind quickly, Mr. Monroe,&#8221;
the general exclaimed anxiously. &#8220;Shell it,
or else let&#8217;s try to get by; we can&#8217;t afford to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
leave the neck of the sack open for Espinosa
and his cutthroats to escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney saw there was no way out of the
situation, save to silence the battery:&mdash;one
shot through the boiler of the &#8220;Mindinao,&#8221;
and the gunboat with all on board would be
killed by the explosion or else drowned in the
madly racing current of the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a few shots at that gun,&#8221; he ordered
hoarsely. The gun-pointers when they heard
the spiteful hiss of the enemy&#8217;s shell had, as
though by an order, ceased their fire and
waited obediently for the command which
they felt sure the midshipman would give.
They did not relish being fired upon and not
allowed to return the fire.</p>

<p>Sydney&#8217;s glasses were upon the cliff: he
saw a group of struggling figures about the
cannon, and then to his surprise and joy the
black object detached itself and dropped
swiftly to the water six hundred feet below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fire,&#8221; he cried out quickly, but the
gun-pointers through their sight telescopes
had also been watching the struggle about
their target and had waited.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>The lad rang up full speed ahead and again
the gunboat sped toward the ca&ntilde;on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open fire on the left flank of the hill,&#8221;
Sydney ordered.</p>

<p>The three-pounders barked, and shell after
shell was sent against the gathering crowds
forming to attack the mere handful on the
right, where the trail ended. The soldiers
under Captain Blynn could now be plainly
seen plodding upward.</p>

<p>Sydney&#8217;s boyish nerves were at the highest
pitch of excitement. He realized that he was
to perform one of the most difficult feats of
his life, and he had the life of a general of the
army in his keeping. An error of judgment
on his part would send them all to their
deaths. He glanced searchingly at the frowning
cliff, now scarcely a thousand yards away.
He could plainly see that at the top a fierce
fight was raging. The narrow gorge ahead
seemed barely wide enough to permit the
gunboat to pass, and above it, he knew only
too well great boulders were standing ready
to be dropped like meteors on the frail deck
of the &#8220;Mindinao.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready there with the Colt gun?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
he called loudly to the sailors in the foretop,
where the gun was mounted.</p>

<p>There was no answer; a glance aloft showed
him the crew of the gun grouped anxiously
about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jammed again, I suppose,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Closer and closer loomed the ca&ntilde;on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out for the prisoner,&#8221; Sydney cried
out as he saw the native, his hands on the
rail, about to leap overboard. Major Marble
was near enough to grasp him and the next
minute ready hands had bound him securely
to the rail and from there he gazed up in
terror at the rapidly approaching cliffs.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the first one,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
excitedly as a great boulder swayed
unsteadily and then rolled slowly over the
edge of the chasm and descended with the
speed of a shooting star. Every man on the
gunboat was on his feet; above them now was
the camp of the outlaws, and several hundred
such boulders were there ready to be dropped
upon their defenseless heads. The firing of
the &#8220;Mindinao&#8217;s&#8221; guns had long since
stopped as the elevation was much too great.</p>

<p>With a terrific splash which hurled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
water completely over the bow of the gunboat,
the first rock took the water; but another
and another followed it in rapid succession,
and so close did they fall that Sydney
felt the rushes of air caused by their passage.
General Wilson stood calmly by as unconcerned
as though he were only a spectator at a
display of fireworks. Major Marble paced
rapidly across the bridge, his hands nervously
clutching a rifle which every few seconds he
would discharge at the frowning cliffs above
him.</p>

<p>To add to the danger there now came the
song of enemy&#8217;s bullets while the water near
the gunboat became disturbed as if from the
fall of hail. Occasionally there was heard a
commotion forward and a man sorely hit
would be carried below decks to be attended by
the hospital corps located in the men&#8217;s quarters.</p>

<p>Many of the soldiers and sailors had now
opened fire with their rifles, but the falling
rocks disconcerted them. Suddenly the Colt
gun commenced its sharp drumming discharge.
Sydney glanced aloft. He could see
his crew directing the stream of lead slowly
covering every point of the cliff ahead.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>A cry of delight rose from the Americans,
and a cheer broke out from the anxious but
relieved men as they noted the immediate effect
of the leaden stream. As it swept along
the cliffs, those who stood ready to project the
balanced rocks upon the heads of their enemy
had taken fright, and instead of waiting until
the gunboat was immediately beneath them,
had in their impatience let go their rocks,
and they were falling harmlessly in the water
ahead of the gunboat. Sydney steered as near
the opposite shore as he dared, fearing that a
boulder might have closed the channel. On
top of the cliff the sound of strife could still
be heard.</p>

<p>Major Marble and Major Lukban anxiously
questioned the prisoner. He alone knew the
whereabouts of the trail which Espinosa and
his men relied upon to furnish an avenue of
escape in case the stronghold was successfully
attacked. The Filipino officer held his revolver
threateningly before the frightened native&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you allow us to pass it, I&#8217;ll have no
mercy,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; had now emerged from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
the dangerous ca&ntilde;on and the sound of firing
above became less distinct.</p>

<p>General Wilson was becoming impatient.
He had held himself well in hand to steady
the officers and men under him during the
trial through which they had passed so successfully.
Now his anxiety was more than he
could keep to himself. He rushed up to the
cringing native, taking him roughly by the
shoulders and crying out to him in English,
a language unintelligible to the terrified prisoner.</p>

<p>But the general&#8217;s act was crowned with success.
The insurgent soldier had steeled himself
against the threats of Major Lukban, even
reinforced as they were with the deadly revolver
held to his head, but the wildly gesticulating
general had put a terrible fear into
his soul. Like all orientals he reverenced and
feared rank, and this taciturn American general
had so suddenly turned upon him that
he was too frightened to do aught else but tell
the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back there is the place,&#8221; the native cried
in his own language, and Major Lukban in
feverish haste translated the man&#8217;s words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
while Sydney swung the gunboat about, reversing
his engines at full speed to keep from
grounding on the rocky shores, and giving
small thought to the dangers of the madly
racing current.</p>

<p>Within ten minutes, which seemed ages to
the eager Americans, the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; was
anchored in the river and the troops were
landed.</p>

<p>Major Lukban with the guide, whose hands
were securely bound to prevent his escape, led
the party through the tangled underbrush
over the secret trail which without the aid of
one who had been there before would have
been impossible. Tediously the distance was
covered, the sounds of battle ever becoming
more distinct. General Wilson&#8217;s age was no
handicap to him as he eagerly pressed forward
behind the native guides.</p>

<p>The enemy, by the volume of rifle fire
which came down to the ears of the anxious
column of soldiers, were making a desperate
stand to recover the advantage lost by the
suddenness of the surprise, and so absorbed
were they with Captain Blynn&#8217;s men that
those under the general&#8217;s command stood on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
the level plateau of the mountain before their
presence was discovered. The sight of this
unexpected force turned the tide for the
Americans and the terrified insurgents threw
away their arms and huddled together, expecting
to be executed by their enemy without
mercy.</p>

<p>General Wilson quietly controlled his eager
soldiers, bent upon annihilating these treacherous
brown men now within their power.
The soldier mind knew but one style of warfare
with a savage foe. No quarter had been
the insurgent watchword. Kill! kill! had
frequently rung in their ears as the fanatical
hordes had charged down upon them on many
a battle-field.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cease firing!&#8221; General Wilson&#8217;s commanding
voice rang out above the discharges
of musketry, and the bugles signaled the
order across the battle-field. &#8220;Major Lukban,
tell them no harm will come to them if they
submit without further resistance,&#8221; he cried
to the native officer at his elbow, pointing toward
the panic-stricken hundreds.</p>

<p>The Filipino major calmly walked forward,
his hands held above his head in sign of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
peace, and raised his voice in his native
language. A hush fell upon the babbling
throngs, while the terror in their eyes slowly
died out and they dropped on their knees,
giving thanks for their miraculous deliverance.</p>

<p>Major Marble and the native officer went
fearlessly among the natives, leading them to
a point near the river, and placed guards
over them to prevent their escape and then,
seeing that a struggle was still going forward
on the eastern side of the mountain, gathered
a force of soldiers about him and hastened
to aid those still in the throes of combat.</p>

<p>Almost out of breath the reinforcing
column arrived in time to greet Phil and
O&#8217;Neil standing on the brink of the precipice
and hear their exclamations of disappointment
at the escape of the coveted insurgent leader.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>THE ESCAPED OUTLAW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lukban</span> was the first to recover from the
stunning news that Espinosa had, by a
miracle, escaped out of the Americans&#8217; hands
when all outlets were supposed to have been
covered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t dare stay in Kapay,&#8221; the
native exclaimed after Phil had explained to
the general the manner of his escape. &#8220;The
natives fear him, but without his followers
and with the incumbrance of Rodriguez&#8217;s
treasure, the dangers he must face will make
him do his utmost to leave the island.&#8221;</p>

<p>General Wilson listened intently, his eyes
wandering over the victorious battle-field behind
him where Captain Blynn&#8217;s men were
quietly disarming the now docile natives.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear we cannot stop him now,&#8221; General
Wilson said disappointedly, &#8220;but I suppose
we should be satisfied with our victory.
This means the end of the war on Kapay.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>Lukban had turned and was earnestly engaged
in conversation with Lopez, and then
he asked several eager questions of Garcia,
who had joined the group. Finally he
turned to General Wilson, his black eyes
snapping with renewed eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lopez wishes to follow him,&#8221; he exclaimed
excitedly. &#8220;He will take his hundred
men, who are only too anxious to see
him captured and punished for his many
crimes, and especially for the murder of
Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez. If he is pressed closely he
will make for the nearest point of escape
which by the trail is Banate. This Garcia
assures me was his intention if he was defeated.
Garcia wishes to go with Lopez, and
he can arrange a signal by fires on the hill
behind the swamps to be seen by the gunboat
at sea. The gunboat must go down the river
at once and at sea await the signal. Espinosa
must attempt his escape by proa to Megras.
It is only fifty miles away and if he reaches
there he will be safe for the time among his
friends living on that island.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s face suddenly beamed in smiles as
Lukban&#8217;s plan slowly unfolded before him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
Highly delighted, he shook hands enthusiastically
with the speaker, until the latter cried
out in pain from the well meant but rough
show of appreciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Marble and I will return with you
at once,&#8221; General Wilson added quietly to
Phil after he had in but a few words approved
the proposed plan. &#8220;Blynn can settle
the question of prisoners. I&#8217;d like to have
Espinosa behind bars before I wire to Manila
giving them this news.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil solemnly told of the sad fate of Lieutenant
Tillotson and the general shook his
head mournfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it is better so,&#8221; he whispered half
to himself, but to Phil, standing close by,
these words from the old soldier&#8217;s heart came
distinctly.</p>

<p>A detail of men carried the body of the
dead officer across the battle-field, and as they
passed solemnly through the joyful troops
who had collected to cheer the white-haired
veteran, the soldiers became suddenly silent
as their eyes fell upon the stretcher and were
told the identity of that figure underneath the
flag. None had reverenced the officer in life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
but in death all were anxious to render respect.</p>

<p>Phil told the general of the pitiful plight of
Lieutenant Tillotson, and of the cruel manner
of his death, and generously praised the doubtful
courage of the army man.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a glorious end for a soldier,&#8221; General
Wilson murmured. &#8220;I have always felt that I
could welcome it, and now,&#8221; he added disappointedly,
&#8220;I shall probably die in my bed
like an ordinary citizen. My career is almost
over; in another year I shall have left active
service behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the general and his party climbed
down the difficult trail to reach the gunboat
at anchor in the river below them, Lopez and
Garcia with their trusty company had nimbly
descended the almost precipitous side of the
mountain and were eagerly following the trail
of the fleeing insurgent and his ill-gotten
spoils.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; steamed fearlessly down
the river, her flag at half-mast in honor of
those whose mortal remains lay covered on
the quarter-deck; the soldiers who had given
their lives in the attack on the most formidable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
of insurgent strongholds. Phil and
O&#8217;Neil were given prompt attention by the
surgeon and several ugly wounds were carefully
dressed. Phil was glad to relinquish
his command to Sydney and remained luxuriously
in his cot.</p>

<p>At Rodriguez&#8217;s ranch the gunboat stopped
and reverently landed the dead heroes, to be
buried in the cemetery, and here General
Wilson and his adjutant-general disembarked
to return to Palilo by road.</p>

<p>Just as the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; started ahead, after
landing her passengers, on its way to the
mouth of the river, a native canoe paddled
rapidly from the landing, and ran up alongside
of the gunboat. An excited hail came
from its occupant, answered by an angry cry
from Major Lukban who turned, his face
deathly pale, and his hands trembling, to the
midshipmen at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;orita Maria is missing,&#8221; he gasped.</p>

<p>The midshipmen were stunned at the suddenness
of this unexpected and disquieting
news. Maria captured! What did it mean?</p>

<p>Lukban declared that his first duty was to
his young mistress and the lads heartily approved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
of his desire to be landed to attempt to
trail the lost girl and her brother.</p>

<p>The excited native was brought on board
from his canoe and told the eager men the
meagre details of her loss.</p>

<p>She and Juan had gone out to the cemetery
in the morning, and had not returned. A
search had been made in the afternoon and
the footprints of men had been discovered,
showing that the girl had fallen into the hands
of a party of natives.</p>

<p>The midshipmen bade good-bye to their native
friend who entered the canoe and paddled
shoreward, and then Phil rang for full speed
ahead on the engines.</p>

<p>&#8220;The loyalty of these natives to the Rodriguez
family is touching,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
in admiration. &#8220;Garcia alone betrayed his
friend; but he did it through superstitious
fear of the Katipunan society. Lopez is as
staunch as a rock, and Lukban, you can see,
would lay down his life willingly for his young
mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two hours later the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; had
steamed through the harbor of Palilo and
turned her bow northward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>During the night Sydney and O&#8217;Neil took
turns with Phil in standing watch on the gunboat&#8217;s
bridge, carefully searching the shore for
the signal agreed upon with Lopez. Would
he succeed in coming up with the fleeing outlaw?</p>

<p>The night wore slowly along and morning
dawned clear, finding all three of the Americans
up and on the bridge of the rapidly moving
vessel.</p>

<p>No sails were in sight. A wide expanse of
water was before them, while on the port hand
the low swamp land of Banate was in plain sight.</p>

<p>Phil steered his ship in toward the bamboo
town nestling in the hollow of two small hills
in the midst of the swampy mouth of the
Mani River. As they approached, the Americans
could discover naught but the usual listless
life of a Filipino village.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll patrol here,&#8221; Phil said, as he steered
further offshore.</p>

<p>All day long the gunboat steamed backward
and forward over fifteen miles of coast line.
An occasional sail was sighted and overhauled,
only to find in it a handful of
frightened fishermen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>As night approached the gunboat was
brought to a stop in the centre of the line of
patrol in order that it might be at an equal
distance from all possible points of departure,
in case Espinosa had eluded his pursuers.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he has a proa in waiting, hidden in the
swamps of one of these estuaries, he will
choose night for his escape,&#8221; Phil declared as
he studied his inaccurate chart, &#8220;and at night
he can easily elude us, for it is too dark to see
a half mile. Our only hope is that there will
be no wind, and if the air is sufficiently calm
we can hear the dip of oars for miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil stationed his sailors as lookouts everywhere,
with orders to listen alertly and make
known to him if they heard the slightest
sound.</p>

<p>The night drew on. The others had gone
below for their broken night&#8217;s sleep, and
Sydney was alone on the bridge. A half dozen
lookouts were alert, peering into the night,
their energies bent on catching the faintest
sound from the distant shore.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sydney&#8217;s ears caught a dull
sound which seemed to come from the direction
of the land. He listened intently, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
breath held tight. The dawn wind brought
to his nostrils the sweet damp smell of earth
mingled with the pungent odor of smoke from
the early morning fires of the villagers.</p>

<p>All lights were extinguished on the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221;
and the midshipman knew that the
vessel was, even at a short distance, invisible.</p>

<p>Now the sound came distinctly to his ears.
It was the steady dip of oars and their rattle
in the locks. He could hear the low muffled
swish as the blades shook themselves clear of
the water.</p>

<p>Several of the lookouts reported in whispers
the presence of the strange craft.</p>

<p>Gradually the sound approached, the boat
invisible, while slowly the gray streak of
dawn spread in the east. The sound was now
located ahead and the boat appeared to be
traveling fast, doubtless propelled by both oars
and sail. Was it only a fisherman going out
early to spread his nets? Or was it the outlaw
Espinosa attempting escape, and carrying
off Rodriguez&#8217;s gold and the more precious
treasures, Maria and Juan?</p>

<p>Sydney sent one of the men to call Phil to
the bridge immediately.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>COLONEL MARTINEZ</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria</span> watched with a heavy heart her
young friend Phil Perry go cheerfully away
to put himself in the hands of the cruel native
leader in his endeavor to save the life of a
brother officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never expect to see him alive again,&#8221; she
whispered sorrowfully to her small brother as
he stood with big round eyes of wonder gazing
at the military preparations for the attack
on the insurgent stronghold.</p>

<p>The next day she and Juan gazed wistfully
after the long column of khaki-clad American
soldiers as they filed silently past the ranch
house, taking the trail over which she and her
American friends had ridden so merrily but a
few days before.</p>

<p>The guard left at the ranch, consisting of
two companies of soldiers, quietly stationed
its sentries and took up the monotonous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
routine of guarding the many supplies which
were arriving by boats from Palilo.</p>

<p>For several long hours the girl brooded
over the situation, wondering how she could
aid the friends for whom she had learned to
hold a high regard. Bemoaning the fate that
had made her a helpless woman, she took
Juan by the hand and strolled away up the
wooded slope toward the family burying
grounds where the body of her father peacefully
rested. Reaching the newly made
mound she placed upon his grave the handful
of flowers which she had gathered. In
her heart was a great bitterness. Juan, too
young to appreciate the magnitude of his loss,
chased gleefully the monkeys which chattered
in the trees about him, leaping almost
into his arms as they eluded his embrace.
Following her brother Maria listlessly strolled
farther into the gloom of the forest.</p>

<p>Suddenly a low whistle from deeper in the
woods attracted her attention. With startled
eyes she stopped, her head erect and her
bosom heaving in sudden fright.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_356.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap2"><i>A MAN STEPPED SILENTLY FROM<br />
BEHIND A TREE</i></p>

<p>A man stepped silently from behind a tree
and walked toward her. With a glad cry she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
ran to him. It was the officer known to the
Americans as Colonel Martinez.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard,&#8221; he said sorrowfully as the
girl incoherently sobbed the sad news of her
father&#8217;s death. &#8220;I would have come sooner,
but I believed the Americans would have
been strong enough to prevent it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His last words were for you, Gregorio,&#8221;
Maria whispered as he patted caressingly her
straight black hair. &#8220;He hoped that you
would follow his example and surrender to
General Wilson. Why do you not take your
own name again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister,&#8221; the insurgent officer answered
earnestly, &#8220;when my father disowned me for
fighting under Aguinaldo in the north, I took
the name of Remundo, and because I would
not surrender after most of my men had
been killed or captured I have been declared
by the government of the islands an outlaw,
and a price was put on my head. I am accused
of many crimes of which I am not
guilty. I have an enemy, who now stands
high in government favor. It was he who
harried the country using my name falsely,
and for his deeds I am blamed. Captain Blynn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
has my written proofs. So you see I could
not comply with our father&#8217;s wish before, but
now I am willing to lay down my life in
order that Juan Rodriguez&#8217;s soul may rest in
peace, which it cannot do until his murderer
has received his just punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>While they talked Gregorio Rodriguez had
taken the small hand of Juan in his own,
leading his sister along a tiny trail away from
the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a few trusty followers awaiting me
a short distance beyond,&#8221; he added, &#8220;and I
wish you both to come with me. Your lives are
too precious to allow you to be out of my sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maria smiled happily and pressed her
brother&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour&#8217;s walk the forest
opened and they found themselves in the
midst of a company of native soldiers. The
men arose from the ground as their leader
passed, doffing their hats to the woman walking
so proudly with their officer. Gregorio
stood silently in their midst, holding up his
hand to demand attention.</p>

<p>In a few short lines he told his men of his
real identity and of the horrible murder of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
his father by Espinosa; of the expedition
which he had watched start out to attack the
stronghold. To serve their best interests, he
told them he should surrender with his force
to the Americans, who would give them all
fair and honorable treatment. Then he raised
his voice and excitedly cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Those who still desire to fight against
their own interests under a traitor and a murderer
may go forth unmolested. At once!&#8221;
he cried, pointing to the trail leading inland,
while his black eyes flashed.</p>

<p>Not a man gave ground; all looked trustfully
up to their leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;Viva los Americanos,&#8221; one shouted and
the woods rang with their lusty cheers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come to the ranch with me and
surrender there to the Americans?&#8221; Maria
asked, after the cheering had died away.</p>

<p>Gregorio shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;My first quest is Espinosa,&#8221; he replied
earnestly. &#8220;At once we shall march toward
the stronghold. If he is captured or killed
in the battle I shall seek General Wilson and
surrender myself and men. If Espinosa escapes
I shall follow him to the death.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>Maria knew the native spirit too well to attempt
to urge her brother to give up this
perilous quest of their father&#8217;s murderer, so
she bowed her head submissively.</p>

<p>An hour saw the band on the march, with
Maria and Juan mounted on two ponies;
quietly the native soldiers led by Gregorio
Rodriguez circled the Americans encamped
at the ranch and struck the trail taken in the
morning by Captain Blynn and his five hundred
soldiers.</p>

<p>Long before they came in sight of the
stronghold the distant rumble of musketry
and the thunder of artillery told them of the
struggle at the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>Despairing of reaching the battle-field by
the treacherous trail already covered by the
Americans, Gregorio led his party to high
ground across the valley from Matiginao.
They arrived breathlessly at the summit and
viewed the distant figures of men fighting in
a hand-to-hand struggle.</p>

<p>Maria gasped in fear as she comprehended
the awful sight of the struggle.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Americans are victorious,&#8221; Gregorio
exclaimed excitedly as he saw the wave of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
khaki sweep from two sides across the broad
plateau. He saw the native insurgents huddled
together in the centre of the American
soldiers. But his eager eyes followed a small
band of Americans and natives on the right
of the mountain; he saw the natives in front
of them give way slowly, contesting the battle-field
foot by foot, while behind them he
saw several score more of natives reach the
edge of the plateau and rapidly disappear
down the sheer side of the cliff.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are escaping,&#8221; he cried in sudden
alarm. &#8220;See, they are holding the Americans
back to give those fleeing time to escape.
It&#8217;s Espinosa,&#8221; he shouted hoarsely, beside
himself with apprehension.</p>

<p>Between him and the valley at the foot of
the precipice, Gregorio knew were many miles
of impenetrable jungle, through which there
was no trail. Yet he must push through this
formidable barrier in an effort to cut off his
enemy&#8217;s escape. Calling up one of his trusty
lieutenants he gave Maria and Juan in his
charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the trail and join the Americans,&#8221;
he ordered his sister. &#8220;Come,&#8221; he commanded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
selecting a score of men by a motion
of his hand. In another minute Gregorio,
followed obediently by his selected followers,
had plunged through the dense woods straight
down the mountainside toward the avenue of
escape over which Espinosa would soon be
traveling, while Maria and her guard left their
place of vantage and headed for the distant
mountain top now in the hands of Captain
Blynn and his victorious men.</p>

<p>Laboriously, but spurred forward by the
eagerness of their leader, Gregorio and his
small band toiled through the dense jungle.
The distance was slowly covered and, almost
exhausted, they were finally rewarded by
reaching the trail leading from the stronghold
to the northward.</p>

<p>Gregorio uttered an exclamation of surprise
as his knowledge of woodcraft told him that
a large force of men had recently passed over
this road. Surely he had seen but a few score
escape from the plateau.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, in the lead, he urged his
men forward. He would attack, no matter
what were the odds against him. Espinosa
should not escape!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>After several hours of strenuous marching a
straggler was found on the side of the trail
and after a hasty interview gave the anxious
native the good tidings that Lopez was ahead
on the same quest as himself.</p>

<p>Hurrying forward, most of the time on a
run, he overtook his father&#8217;s faithful servant
just before darkness arrived, and together, unsparingly,
they urged onward their tired men.</p>

<p>Gregorio&#8217;s keen eyes were ever on the trail;
in his heart was a desperate resolve. The
thought of escape of Espinosa maddened him
beyond endurance. The newly made grave in
the family burying grounds spurred him on
to almost superhuman exertions. Lopez,
hardened as he was to toil in the fields, kept
pace with his untiring young master, but
many of the pursuing natives were left far behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are nearly to Banate,&#8221; Lopez said intensely
as they saw the high jungle slowly
merge into nipa swamp. The cocoanut palms
were becoming more and more infrequent and
the mud of the trail clung to their tired feet.</p>

<p>So silently had they approached the little
settlement at the foot of the hills rising from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
the delta of the river that the sudden barking
of a dog caused them to stop in consternation.</p>

<p>With eyes open wide with anxiety and apprehension,
Gregorio and Lopez pressed onward
through the narrow street. They saw
the natives were not as yet awake, the houses
were closed and no human being was visible.
On the ocean beach they saw many native
boats hauled high above the tide. Anxiously
they visited each in turn, but all were abandoned.</p>

<p>The sandy soil gave them no news of their
quarry. Many footmarks were evident, but
the tracks were so crossed and recrossed that
even Gregorio gave up all hope of learning
from them the direction taken by Espinosa
and his men.</p>

<p>Gregorio stood in deepest dejection at the
edge of the beach; his eyes sorrowfully scanned
the dark waters. Had Espinosa turned off
into the jungle, allowing him to go by, chuckling
in his sleeve at the cleverness of his
ruse? or had he embarked, and was he now
sailing rapidly away toward freedom and
wealth? Many of the straggling natives had
now gathered about their chief and waited for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
his orders. They had ruthlessly entered the
huts of the sleeping villagers and had dragged
several of them trembling before their leaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;But a half hour ago a large proa was
launched from down the beach,&#8221; a native villager
spoke up. &#8220;It had been waiting, and
we were commanded to keep indoors on
penalty of being shot. Through my bamboo
shutter I saw it start.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gregorio waited for no further words.
Hastily turning to Lopez and Garcia he cried
eagerly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Light three fires on the top of the hill,
the signal to the gunboat.&#8221; Then without
spoken orders a half score of men helped the
anxious Gregorio launch one of the small fishing
boats lying high on the beach. As Lopez
and his men hurried away, the native boat, with
Gregorio at the helm, hoisted its bamboo sail
to catch the light morning breeze and disappeared
into the night.</p>

<small>THE GUNBOAT ON GUARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;There&#8217;s</span> a fire ashore there, sir,&#8221; a lookout
called in an eager voice as Phil accompanied
by O&#8217;Neil stepped on deck, and the midshipman&#8217;s
joy was unbounded as he saw three
points of light gradually grow into three unmistakable
fires.</p>

<p>&#8220;The signal,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got
him. He can&#8217;t escape us now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eagerly he listened to the sweet music of
those hollow sounds caused as he knew by the
play of the oars in their rowlocks. Scarcely
a half mile away was Espinosa, blissfully unconscious
of the presence of his sentinel gunboat.
Then a great fear came into his mind
as he thought of the cargo the approaching
boat might be carrying. Were Maria and her
brother captives of this cruel villain?</p>

<p>The anxious midshipman rang the engine
bell for full speed ahead and the little gunboat
quickly leaped to life. Espinosa was as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
good as captured. Inside of an hour day
would break.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep a sharp lookout,&#8221; he shouted. The
gunboat&#8217;s bow had turned directly for the
sound of the passing boat and he did not
know at what moment it would appear suddenly
from out of the darkness ahead.</p>

<p>Sydney and O&#8217;Neil stood beside Phil as the
gunboat rushed forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Espinosa, all right,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed
joyfully as he went below, after taking
a look about him, to get the forward three-pounder
ready.</p>

<p>The two midshipmen strained their ears in
vain into the night, but no sound of their
quarry was evident.</p>

<p>The gunboat was again stopped and the
word passed for silence. A stillness crept
over the gunboat. The sailors stood alert,
silent in strained attitudes of listening, but no
sound could be heard to cheer the now depressed
Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve stopped rowing,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed,
&#8220;and with this breeze they must be
going away from us fast.&#8221; The midshipmen
gazed at each other in consternation. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
should be done? Should they steam ahead
blindly, awaiting the day? Might not the
proa have discovered the presence of the
gunboat and changed its course? Both knew
that ten miles to the eastward treacherous coral
reefs covered the sea, through which the gunboat
must navigate cautiously, even if it were
possible to go at all. Was the outlaw again
to escape? Then their attention was attracted
by a new sound as the chug of oars came to
their ears, but this time from a direction opposite
to that taken by the first boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a second boat,&#8221; Phil exclaimed in a
troubled voice. &#8220;What can it mean?&#8221; The
noise of the approaching boat came closer and
closer and then suddenly out of the night a
great sail appeared, while a Spanish hail drifted
across the waters:</p>

<p>&#8220;Espinosa is in a proa ahead of us. This
is Colonel Martinez.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads recognized their friend&#8217;s voice,
even before he declared his identity, and now
with his mind made up that he must act
quickly, Phil called back:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall steam directly ahead for the reefs;
stand by to take a line.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>The active natives caught the tow-line
heaved to them from the stern of the gunboat,
and the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; at full speed raced toward
the gray in the eastern sky, while the
proa astern lowered her sail and leaped joyfully
in tow of the steamer.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil stood like a statue at the bow&#8217;s gun,
his eyes endeavoring to pierce the gloom
ahead. His eager eyes were conscious of the
growing light. Farther and farther his range
of vision grew; now a mile of sea on either
bow was in sight, but barren of sail. Then
from out the dissolving mist, the sailor saw a
dim shadow and knew that the quarry at last
was found and in easy range.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see her, sir,&#8221; he hailed joyfully. &#8220;Can
I give her a polite invitation to heave to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hit her, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Phil answered excitedly;
&#8220;put a shell as close as you can.
She&#8217;s nearly up to the reefs.&#8221;</p>

<p>A roar and a blinding flash was O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s
answer to his captain&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>Shell after shell was hurled after the fleeing
boat but the Americans could see no inclination
to obey the order of the challenge. Now
silhouetted against the eastern sky, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
great spread of sail, Espinosa was straining
everything to escape. From out the sea ahead
a fiery sun arose, throwing its brilliant light
into the eyes of those on the gunboat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Phil urged earnestly.
&#8220;Se&ntilde;orita Rodriguez may be in that boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s safe with our soldiers,&#8221; Sydney
called from the deck below, at hearing his
friend&#8217;s caution. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just talked with
Martinez astern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put a shot in that boat,&#8221; Phil cried, and
the roar of the three-pounder echoed his words.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a gentle tremble of the
&#8220;Mindinao&#8221; made her young captain turn
pale, as he rang for full speed astern.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re on the reef,&#8221; he cried in anguish.
&#8220;What shall we do? Hit her, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; he
called beside himself; &#8220;he must not escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney had rushed aft with several sailors
close at his heels and taking the tow-line of
the native boat astern, they hauled it up clear
of the backing screws until the outrigger was
alongside the gangway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make room for ten of our sailors,&#8221; he
shouted to Martinez. &#8220;We want men who
know how to shoot.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>While the water boiled above the swiftly revolving
propellers slowly hauling the gunboat
backward from its perilous position on a coral
reef, all but two of the natives in the fishing
boat climbed nimbly aboard and ten eager
sailors, their rifles in hand, scrambled in.</p>

<p>The sharp detonations of the three-pounder
added to the confusion of the scene.</p>

<p>As he saw the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; was again
afloat, Phil turned his eyes to the fleeing
enemy. The boat, still untouched, was sailing
swiftly away with an ever-increasing
breeze behind it. Then his eyes opened in
surprise and joy as he saw what Sydney had
been doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, O&#8217;Neil, she&#8217;s nearly out of
range,&#8221; he called excitedly. The sailor
turned, took in the situation at a glance and
seizing a rifle from a sailor near him followed
his captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dropped her sail,&#8221; he cried, as a
swift look over his shoulder to mark the effect
of the last shot revealed but a small black
speck on the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Syd, but I must leave you to
look out for the ship,&#8221; Phil said as he leaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
for the side of the native boat and grasped
Colonel Martinez&#8217;s hands. &#8220;Keep us in sight
and see if you can work her through the reefs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney drew a long face, but he appreciated
that Phil&#8217;s greatest desire was to be in at the
death, when Espinosa was captured.</p>

<p>The boat shoved off and the bamboo sail,
far bigger in proportion than the sails carried
by American boats, was quickly hoisted. The
boat appeared to skim over the surface of the
water. The gunboat slowly dropped astern,
but now the proa had again hoisted its
sail and the distance between the two boats
seemed to be ever the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll catch him if we have to chase him
the whole fifty miles of water and then some,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil cried angrily. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how I
could have missed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil smiled feebly. &#8220;You were beginning
to get pretty close,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They lowered
their sail so as to offer a smaller target for you
to aim at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d done it with a shell,&#8221;
the boatswain&#8217;s mate replied disappointedly.
&#8220;Well, if we get within the range of this little
piece of iron,&#8221; patting his rifle, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
great pleasure in writing my initials on that
Espinosa&#8217;s yellow carcass.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipman did not take this soft-hearted
sailorman seriously. In a fight, he
knew he was as brave as twenty men, but
with a vanquished enemy he was as gentle as
a woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we can catch him alive, I don&#8217;t wish to
kill him,&#8221; Phil answered now, in Spanish, to
include Rodriguez, who had not understood
the declarations of the disappointed sailor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I claim the privilege of doing that, Se&ntilde;or
Perry,&#8221; the colonel replied.</p>

<p>Phil regarded him sternly. The native
looked into the midshipman&#8217;s eyes unwaveringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you?&#8221; the lad asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, se&ntilde;or, I had forgotten,&#8221; the native
said earnestly, taking his revolver from its
holster and holding it butt forward to the
midshipman. &#8220;Colonel Remundo in Luzon,
Colonel Martinez in Kapay, and now Gregorio
Rodriguez, surrenders to you as a prisoner of
war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil looked aghast, while O&#8217;Neil mumbled
inarticulate nautical phrases of surprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>&#8220;Are you then Maria&#8217;s brother?&#8221; the lad
asked.</p>

<p>Gregorio nodded his head slowly, still holding
his revolver for Phil to take.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put your revolver back,&#8221; the midshipman
ordered peremptorily. &#8220;You and I never
have been enemies&mdash;except for a very short
time,&#8221; he added as the remembrance of those
two anxious days after his capture on the
&#8220;Negros&#8221; came into his mind. &#8220;Anyway,
we have now the same objective, that murderer
yonder, but,&#8221; and he lowered his voice
to a cold, hard tone, &#8220;you shall not kill him
if we can capture him alive. I forbid it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gregorio&#8217;s black eyes blazed, and despite
the avowed friendship of the native, O&#8217;Neil
reached hastily for his revolver. Then as
suddenly the native mastered himself and
with a shrug turned away his telltale eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how you feel, colonel,&#8221; Phil declared
conscious of the passion in the native&#8217;s
soul, &#8220;but I&#8217;d rather have it done regularly.
We&#8217;ll try him by a military commission for
treason and hang him in the Plaza in Palilo
as a warning to all traitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly the fishing boat overhauled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
bigger craft. Now the distance was but five
hundred yards. The sun had risen and
shone down on the green opalescent water.
A report of a rifle-shot startled the Americans
who had settled themselves for a long and
monotonous chase.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they are going to offer resistance,&#8221;
Phil exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; let him have it, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; he added
as the sailor threw the muzzle of his piece
forward and looked questioningly at the midshipman.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s rifle cracked and a figure standing
on the rail near the mast doubled up and fell
forward in the boat.</p>

<p>A fusillade of shots followed from the fleeing
boat, the bullets hissing in the water
dangerously near the dozen huddled Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t allow this,&#8221; Phil exclaimed uneasily;
&#8220;they can&#8217;t miss us if we get any closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open fire!&#8221; he ordered suddenly.</p>

<p>Ten rifles were discharged almost as one,
and as quickly fired again and again. The
sharp rattle of the breech-blocks was continuous.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>By this time the Americans had approached
abreast the enemy, but above its rail no
human being was visible. Had all been
killed by the unerring shooting of Phil&#8217;s
men?</p>

<p>Scarcely twenty yards separated the two
boats. The larger craft, with sheets slacked,
sailed silently onward. The helm swung
idle; the hand that had steered it probably
now lay limp in the bottom of the proa.
Phil rose cautiously, his hand grasping the
sail; he placed his foot on the high gunwale
in an endeavor to discover the state of the
enemy concealed in the bottom of the boat. As
he drew himself up above his companions, the
two boats slid noiselessly nearer and to the
lad&#8217;s horror he suddenly found himself looking
squarely into the black muzzle of a pistol.
Behind it burned the cruel eyes of Espinosa,
while on the latter&#8217;s face was a leer of triumph.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Scarcely</span> a second elapsed between the
time Espinosa had leaped to the proa&#8217;s
deck and the discharge of his revolver, but in
that second Phil had seen the awful havoc
among the traitor&#8217;s followers. Espinosa himself,
sorely wounded as he was, could hardly
have helped hitting his mark. Phil was
conscious of a shot from his own boat almost
simultaneously with a sharp pain in his left
shoulder, and saw the would-be slayer pitch
forward into the sea. In that second the outriggers
of the two boats came together and
Gregorio and his two natives quickly jumped
on board to lower the captured vessel&#8217;s sails,
while O&#8217;Neil put the helm of his own craft
over to bring the wind ahead and stop their
progress.</p>

<p>Phil balanced himself on the sail of the
boat, his eyes following the bubbles which
closed over the body of the wounded man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
Then a trembling seized him as a great black
fin protruded from the water and the sun&#8217;s
rays reflected deep red against the green of
the reef.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sharks,&#8221; he cried hoarsely, balancing
himself with a great effort, for he had been
about to plunge overboard to rescue his
enemy.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil as if by intuition had seized the
lad by the foot and forcibly hauled him back
into the boat.</p>

<p>The two boats were soon secured together
and the Americans, putting aside their weapons
of destruction, looked down pityingly
upon the terrified natives huddled together
in the bottom of the proa. Many were
wounded by the Krag bullets and several
had died not knowing pain, so swiftly had
death come. Far astern a black curl of
smoke marked the gunboat.</p>

<p>All hands turned to willingly and administered
to the stricken enemy and soon all the
wounded were made as comfortable as possible,
their bleeding stanched, while the two
boats were being steered toward the west.
The treasure was found hidden under the footboards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
of the proa and this treasure had
sealed the traitor&#8217;s doom, for in carrying it he
had delayed his flight, allowing Gregorio and
Lopez to all but overtake him.</p>

<p>Inside of two hours the &#8220;Mindinao,&#8221;
steaming cautiously between the numberless
shoals, took the Americans and their captives
on board and was steaming joyfully back to
Palilo with her glad tidings.</p>

<p>The wound in Phil&#8217;s shoulder turned
out happily to be but a glancing blow and
under Sydney&#8217;s administration he suffered
only the inconvenience of carrying his arm
in a black silk sling about his neck.</p>

<p>As Phil brought his gunboat for the last
time to her berth, there on the dock stood
General Wilson and his aides, and before the
gangway had been down a moment they came
on board to praise the work of the navy men,
and hear the thrilling story of the end of
Espinosa.</p>

<p>A sad-eyed stranger in civilian&#8217;s clothes
stood silently by as Phil modestly told how
the outlaw had died. Then he grasped the
lad&#8217;s hand while the general murmured a
name which made the young man blush as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
with shame. He stood in the presence of
Lieutenant Tillotson&#8217;s father.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; the bereaved man said in a low
voice, &#8220;you have a father&#8217;s blessing. The
general has told me of your unselfish and
reckless act in a vain endeavor to save my son.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil turned away to hide his emotion.</p>

<p>Mr. Tillotson, taking the body of his son,
sailed the following day for Manila.</p>

<p>For ten days the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; remained
quietly at her dock, while from all over the
island there came to Palilo to surrender to
the general small bands of insurgent soldiers.
Gregorio Rodriguez, the acknowledged leader
after Espinosa&#8217;s death, had sent word to all his
captains to stop fighting, and their obedience
was instant.</p>

<p>One evening somewhat over a week later,
on board the &#8220;Mindinao&#8221; a dinner party was
in progress. The happy general, a weight of
care lifted from his shoulders, sat on Phil&#8217;s
right, while about the board were the well-known
faces of his friends. O&#8217;Neil, barred
by naval etiquette from partaking at his captain&#8217;s
table, in the shadow of the night, stood
near, hanging on every word spoken. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
Chinese servants with smiling faces flitted between
the galley and the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>Maria sat between the two midshipmen, and
the sadness in her eyes still lingered, but a
look of admiration would kindle as she talked
to each of her two friends in turn.</p>

<p>General Wilson held in his hand two unopened
telegrams which had just been handed
him by an orderly.</p>

<p>The general tore one of the yellow envelopes
and ran his eye hurriedly over the contents.</p>

<p>&#8220;My congratulations, governor,&#8221; he exclaimed,
as he passed the paper to Gregorio
Rodriguez.</p>

<p>The native could hardly believe his eyes,
for these were the words he read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gregorio Rodriguez appointed civil governor
of the Island of Kapay to-day by the
governor-general.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rodriguez rose to his feet and strode quietly
to the general&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Wilson,&#8221; he said reverently, &#8220;this
fulfils my father&#8217;s dearest wish. I would that
he could know.&#8221; Then he dropped on one
knee and, much to the surprise of the gray-haired
prosaic veteran, raised the blue-veined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
hand to his lips. Maria remained seated, but
her dark eyes beamed lovingly on her brother.</p>

<p>Then the other telegram was opened and a
smile appeared on the warrior&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>The lads were consumed with impatience,
for by the look in the general&#8217;s eyes they
realized it concerned them. He read the
message.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I am appointed ambassador to Japan.
Have selected Blynn as military attach&eacute; and
Midshipmen Perry and Monroe naval attach&eacute;s
to our embassy. Wire their answers.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Tillotson.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The midshipmen&#8217;s hearts beat fast and they
were about to cry out their delight, when the
tearful face of Maria caught their eye; and
instead Phil answered soberly, &#8220;I doubt if
we have sufficient rank to accept.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil had heard enough, and as he moved
forward toward his hammock slung on the
forecastle he murmured gruffly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let &#8217;em go alone. They need me
to look out for them.&#8221; And Phil and Sydney,
had they heard, would have said he was
right.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
